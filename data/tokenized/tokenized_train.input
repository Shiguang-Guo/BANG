new questions about attacking iraq ; is tor ##turing terrorists necessary ?
beg ##ala well , we ' ll debate that later on in the show .
we ' ll have a couple of experts come out , so i ' ll with ##hold my comments until then .
even as the secretary of homeland security was putting his people on high alert last month , a 30 - foot cuban patrol boat with four heavily armed men landed on american shores , utterly und ##ete ##cted by the coast guard secretary ridge now leads .
now , why has our president placed homeland security in the hands of republican political hack ##s instead of professionals , by the way ? attorney general john ash ##croft , for example , is a career politician .
he lost an election to a dead man .
secretary of homeland security tom ridge is another career politician who was passed over by mr . bush for the vice presidency .
and deputy secretary of homeland security asa hutchinson is yet another career politician and a graduate of the disgrace ##ful bob jones university .
apparently , mr . bush only turns to professionals when it ' s really important , like political consulting .
novak paul , as i understand your definition of a political - - of a professional politician based on that is somebody who is elected to public office .
now in your administration , the clinton administration , there were these members of the cabinet who by your definition were professional politicians - - lloyd bent ##sen , les as ##pin , william s . cohen , janet reno , bruce ba ##bb ##itt , mike es ##py , dan g ##lick ##man , norman mine ##ta , henry cis ##ner ##os , federico pena , bill richardson , richard riley , 12 of them , not to mention former democratic national chairman ron brown , and one of the great professional politicians of all time , bill daly .
beg ##ala and you know what , they did a hell of a job for our country .
and these bo ##zos let four armed cuban ##s land on our shores when they ' re trying to make a high terrorist alert .
our president has put homeland security in the hands of failed republican hack ##s .
hire professionals , mr . president .
novak so it ' s ok - - it ' s ok to have professional politicians at the justice department and the pentagon . . .
beg ##ala janet reno was a career prosecutor .
novak just a minute , let me finish my sentence , please .
it ' s ok to put democratic career politicians at the pentagon and the justice department if they ' re democrats but not if they ' re republicans , is that right ?
beg ##ala no , the difference is janet reno was a career prosecutor .
( cross ##talk )
beg ##ala john ash ##croft was n ' t half the woman that janet reno was .
novak another potential democratic presidential candidate pondered whether to run , and he made his announcement , and surprise , surprise , the answer was no .
senator christopher dodd of connecticut made the announcement today that he would not be the 10th candidate for the nomination .
why not ? surely chris dodd is at least more credible than carol mo ##sel ##ey - braun or dennis ku ##cini ##ch .
he explained he could better spend the next two years on homeland security , the economy and judicial nominations .
i guess that means hara ##ssing tom ridge , fighting tax cuts and ob ##st ##ru ##cting president bush ' s plans to reform judiciary .
some two years .
beg ##ala god , i hope so .
that ' s all i can say .
i love senator dodd .
he would have brought a lot to the race .
he brings a lot to the senate and to the debate .
and i ' m glad that he ' s going to be fighting those fights .
well , the commerce department reports today that consumer spending declined in january and that the manufacturing sector slowed in february .
in all , two million americans have lost their jobs under president bush so far , not to mention three of them being the top three leaders of his economic team .
meanwhile , the deficit now at $ 300 billion .
it could swell to as much as $ 500 billion if we go to war in iraq .
mr . bush apparently is un ##tro ##ub ##led by this fiscal collapse .
one of his aide ##s tells the current issue of " time , " magazine , quote , " even if it ' s $ 500 billion , so what ? " of course , even a $ 500 billion deficit number does n ' t count the $ 3 trillion mr . bush is robb ##ing from the social security trust fund .
you know , we should have known , every time george w . bush gets in trouble , he borrow ##s from a trust fund .
it ' s been his whole life , you know .
novak let me give you two economic facts of like , which you should know , even if you wo n ' t recognize them .
number one , there is absolutely no relationship between the deficit and unemployment .
they do n ' t go together .
and number two , there is no social security fund , virginia . there just is n ' t one .
beg ##ala because bush sq ##uan ##der ##ed it on his tax cuts .
novak there never has been one .
beg ##ala there has been one for 60 years .

new questions about attacking iraq ; is tor ##turing terrorists necessary ?
novak former arkansas governor and u . s . senator dale bumper ##s has just published a memoir called " the best lawyer in a one - lawyer town . " and it spans his life from the depression era to the clinton era .
let ' s ask him which was more de ##pressing .
beg ##ala first , thank you for writing this book .
it is extraordinary .
it is wonderful .
and then we read you one passage .
you cite a session you had with president lyndon johnson in austin , i guess , at his ranch , right ? here is what you quote our president johnson to you .
" when i was majority leader , and later president , i spent all my time pulling every power string i could find to pull , trying to pass bills that helped people . that made their lives better and the country stronger .
that ' s what the democrats stand for .
" " republicans ?
republicans just stand for two things : protecting the rich and investigation democrats . " that ' s true , though , is n ' t it ?
johnson was right , was n ' t he ?
bumper i thought that was one of the most pre ##sc ##ient things i ever heard , and that was long before white water .
beg ##ala yes .
he never heard of ken starr , but he anticipated it .
bumper ##s nothing ever changes , paul .
novak can i interrupt this democratic picnic for just a minute ?
you know , senator , inadvertently , you gave support in this book to one of my pet political themes , which you probably do n ' t agree with .
on page 256 you say , " as the years went by " - - this is when you were in the senate - - " less and less information was new , fewer and fewer arguments were fresh , and the repetitive ##ness of the old arguments became tires ##ome . " " i was becoming almost as cynical as my constituents .
i knew it was time to leave .
" is n ' t that a great argument for term limits ?
i know very few senators or any who are as good in their third term as they are in their first term .
should n ' t we limit them to two terms ?
bumper ##s first of all , that statement is not designed to cover everybody in the united states senate .
but i must say , that ' s a pretty accurate statement . but it has nothing do with term limits , in my opinion .
i think term limits is the worst idea i ever heard of .
( applause )
beg ##ala am ##en .
novak i tried at least .
beg ##ala let me turn one more page , to page 257 , actually , right next door to where bob was reading .
this struck me because you ' ve got the courage to say something that is here ##tical today and it ' s music to my ears .
you say , " partisans ##hip has taken on an odi ##ous con ##not ##ation , and it may indeed be shrill ##er now than ever .
but we should n ' t lose sight of the fact that we have two political parties so people will have choices .
if everybody agreed on everything , it might be a tran ##quil society , but it surely would be a do ##le one , and certainly not certainly a good one . "
bumper ##s you know , paul , that ' s the reason we have two parties , so people have a choice .
and i ' ve said many times , if we all agreed on everything , everybody would want to marry betty and we would really be in a mess , would n ' t we , bob ?
novak senator bumper ##s , of the 22 senators of the old confederacy , when i got to washington with the associated press , 45 years ago , 22 of them were democrats , nine were republicans .
now 13 are republicans and nine are democrats .
and of the democrats , i do n ' t think there is a real liberal . your last year in the senate i had an interview with you and i wrote a column called " the last southern liberal . "
bumper ##s and i thank you .
it was a very flat ##tering article , bob .
novak and you said , i ' ll quote it , you said , today ' s southern voters are " children of democrats who are not swayed by the same things their mothers and fathers were .
they certainly are susceptible to the republican message .
" that ' s a good future for the democratic party in the south .
bumper ##s bob , i think that the reason everybody in the south - - you know , first of all , we were - - when franklin roosevelt was elected president , we had been living what we thought was still a conquered nation after the civil war .
and we felt that franklin roosevelt was the first person who ever really acknowledged that the south had peculiar problems .
and from that time on , that ' s the reason we had 22 democratic senators from 11 confederate states , is because of the civil war and because of what we thought was a heavy hand of the federal government all the time .
of course there was always that old story about the yankees , and yankees were synonymous with republicans .
but that ' s all changed and memories have dim ##med .
and people , you know , they do n ' t remember that .
and so the message , the republicans have actually had a golden opportunity to make their case and they ' ve done it successfully .
and the democrats need desperately to get a message to counter that , and they need to get a message and stay on it .
i mean we can not be all over the lot .
( cross ##talk )
novak ( un ##int ##elli ##gible ) they ' re just not buying the new deal anymore in the south .
is n ' t that the truth ?
bumper ##s well , that ' s true .
they ' re not buying a new deal .
but i ' ll tell you the message the democrats ought to be - - that every time we get sort of within the grasp of the golden age , i mean within reach of the golden age , where everybody has health care , where everybody gets a good education - - you know i ' m one of the million and a half people - - my brother went to harvard , i went to northwestern university .
two schools my father could n ' t have even thought about afford ##ing .
a million and a half veterans came out of war world ii on the gi bill and got that kind of an education .
if that makes me a liberal , because i believe the government has a role to play in that , then i am a certified liberal , because i think that made the country stronger .
i think certainly it made every one of those people stronger , and i think we ought to be doing it right now .
no child in this country ought to be deprived of an education for lack of money .
no elderly person ought to have to make a choice between food and medicine .
and they do it by the millions every day .
and now . . .
( applause )
beg ##ala will you run for president ?
i ' ll chair a committee .
dale bumper ##s for president , ladies and gentlemen .
thank you very much .
bumper ##s thank you , paul .
beg ##ala that was just terrific .
the book again is dale bumper ##s , " the best lawyer in a one - lawyer town .
" i highly recommend it .
and next in our " fire ##back " segment , one of our viewers has a question about our president ' s concept of democracy .

new questions about attacking iraq ; is tor ##turing terrorists necessary ?
novak time for " fire ##back , " when the viewers fire back at us .
joshua ho ##sford of newport beach , california - - that would be nice in this weather ##s - - " paul , i guess we ' re going after all .
case in point , khalid sha ##ikh mohammed .
it ' s amazing how someone can actually do two things at once . i ' m chewing gum and talking on the phone while writing this note . " joshua , you could n ' t have said anything better .
in fact , i ' ve already said it .
beg ##ala well , in fact , our allies got mr . mohammed along with us .
we need allies . and bush is so far angered every ally we have .
dan snyder of baden , pennsylvania writes , " bush should torture the al qaeda chief operations officer .
bush has been tor ##turing americans for two years .
why should this guy get prefer ##ential treatment ?
"
( laughter )
novak and i thought he was - - i thought he was busy running the redskins .
no ? ok .
the next comment is from frank mast ##ro of new york city . " mr . novak , i do n ' t understand the problem .
if the budget goes through as is , why do n ' t mr . beg ##ala and mr . car ##ville just donate the extra tax money they do n ' t want ?
" i say that to all the rich millionaire democrats , like car ##ville and beg ##ala , who do n ' t want tax cuts .
pay it anyway .
beg ##ala i ' ll donate to the democrats .
they ' ll defeat bush and everybody will get rich .
that ' s a better strategy .
david horn of long island , new york , writes , " how can bush say he ' s for democracy ?
he had to sue to become our president , and he keeps trying to bribe other countries ' democratic governments into his supporting his agenda .
where did he learn to govern , 1930 ' s chicago ? "

question from the audience .
unidentified male hi .
i ' m paul ava ##lar ( ph ) from te ##mp ##e , arizona .
i had a question also about khalid sha ##ikh mohammed .
and now how are people going to argue that the u . s . can no longer both fight a war with iraq and also fight terrorism , specifically al qaeda ?
novak that ' s a great question .
it ' s an una ##ns ##wer ##able point .
he has n ' t been able to answer it .
and tom andrews ( ph ) was n ' t able to answer it .
beg ##ala look , we need allies to catch these guys .
we got him because the pakistani ##s got him .
we did n ' t get him .
we go to war in iraq , 200 , 000 people start protesting in pakistan , they put too much pressure on the government .
it becomes impossible for those governments to cooperate with us like they ' re cooper ##ating now .
we go to war in iraq , it would be the worst thing we can do . . .
novak you know the one thing the democrats ca n ' t stand is good news .
it is just something you can not handle .
beg ##ala no .
what i ca n ' t stand is a president who is going to screw up our war against terrorism when i thought that was his job .

interview with ralph nad ##er , donald palm ##isan ##o ; interview with congress ##men j . d . hay ##worth , bernie sanders
novak welcome back .
both the ama and the bush administration released reports this week saying out of control trial lawyers are driving doctors out of their practices all across the country .
president bush points this way today , even the most fr ##ivo ##lous of lawsuits cost money , premium ##s go up and either way , the patient pays .
we ' re debating mal ##pr ##actic ##e reform with consumer advocate ralph nad ##er , and ama president - elect dr . ronald palm ##isan ##o .
beg ##ala dr . palm ##isan ##o , again , thanks for staying with us through the break .
let me set aside the h ##yp ##oc ##ris ##y of a man who became president because of a lawsuit trying to eliminate everybody else ' s lawsuits , but instead focus on his own experience .
he was the governor of my state of texas , where there are a whole lot of doctors .
it turns out that he did n ' t do any kind of a job policing your profession at all when he was the governor of texas .
here ' s what the " dallas morning news " reported recently : " the texas state board of medical examiner ##s , the agency that pledge ##s to protect the public has granted second and third chances to surgeons who are thrown out of hospitals because they bot ##ched operations .
it has forgiven physicians who overlook cancer ##ous tumors , who mai ##med infants or whose mistakes left women ste ##ril ##ized .
it has refused in the last five years to rev ##oke the license of a single doctor for committing medical errors .
thousands more may have been ignored over the last decade .
" that is the bush record in policing surgeons , why should we trust him now ?
palm ##isan ##o well , first off . . .
beg ##ala physicians generally , not just surgeons , forgive me .
palm ##isan ##o sure .
what we need to do is to make sure that state boards , number one , have adequate funding .
the ama supports that .
if there are any bad doctors we want them removed from the practice of medicine .
but it ' s also . . .
( cross ##talk )
beg ##ala . . . bad doctors ?
palm ##isan ##o well , it ' s also unfair to make a judgment without knowing all of the facts of the case .
because someone pays money in a case , the insurance company may pay money because they ' re afraid there ' s is going to be a giant award in this case because of this broken liability system .
troy brennan ( ph ) of harvard said there ' s no correlation with negligence , only with disability .
so let ' s look at all of the facts , but give everybody due process here in america before we critic ##ize .
nad ##er actually , troy brennan , the same doctor at harvard public school of health said the issue is not to fuel lawsuits , it ' s too many .
less than 10 percent of the victims of medical mal ##pr ##actic ##e , and we ' re talking about horrific injuries here , even file a claim .
even file a claim .
and the entire pay - out to all of the victims that get a little money , not the 90 percent who never file a claim , amounts to less than what we spend on dog food .
on dog food .
it ' s about $ 5 . 4 billion is the pay - out .
that ' s a fraction of physician income .
it ' s a fraction of the health care expense of 1 . 4 trillion .
palm ##isan ##o what we have to do is look at all the facts and have balance here .
that ' s what the people in congress have to do .
they have to make sure that whatever they decide keeps doctors in practice and patients having access to care .
nad ##er doctors are going . . .
palm ##isan ##o but let me - but let me - wait . . .
nad ##er doctors are leaving practice because of insurance premium , right ?
is that right ?
they do n ' t abandon their patients , except for the high premium ##s of a few special ##ties ?
palm ##isan ##o because of the premium ##s .
but first of all let me . . .
nad ##er why do n ' t you crack down on the insurance companies ?
palm ##isan ##o no .
let ' s talk about the facts .
let ' s talk about the facts .
nad ##er that ' s the fact .
palm ##isan ##o ( un ##int ##elli ##gible ) percent of the doctors are ins ##ured by physician - owned insurance companies , the medical side .
i was just in oklahoma , they own this insurance company .
they are trying to do their very best .
it ' s a company not for profit .
what happens here is that more money is being paid out than comes in .
and as far as the investment income , a . m . best ##s ( ph ) show that in the past five years , the investment income has been stable at around 5 percent .
brown brothers ha ##rri ##man said that investments did not pre ##ci ##pit ##ate the current crisis .
( cross ##talk )
nad ##er . . . pay ##offs have been stable , adjusted for inflation , national practitioners data ##bank ( ph ) .
why do you want that to be secret ?
all of the information about bad doctors in the national practitioner bank , you , the ama wants to keep it secret from other doctors and other patients around the country who want to know whether their doctor is on that list .
novak well , let ' s look at what the president is actually proposing for people who have been harmed by a bad doctor .
let ' s listen to what he said to the ama today .
( begin video clip )
bush if harmed by a doc , they ought to be able to recover their economic costs , economic losses .
they should be able to recover non - economic damages as well .
but for the sake of the system , non - economic damages should be capped at $ 250 , 000 .
( end video clip )
novak what in the world is wrong with that ?
tell me what ' s wrong with that ?
nad ##er what ' s wrong ?
tell someone who had a double mast ##ect ##omy , tell an infant who ' s brain - damaged and has no economic loss that for the rest of their lives they ' re going to get dr ##ib ##bled out $ 250 , 000 for their entire life expect ##ancy ?
wait a minute .
the head of ai ##g a few years ago was making $ 250 , 000 every week .
novak two hundred and fifty thousand dollars is a lot of money , though .
not for you , but for most people it ' s a lot of money .
( cross ##talk )
nad ##er these executives , why do n ' t you tell . . .
palm ##isan ##o in california - wait , mr . nad ##er .
in california . . .
nad ##er why do n ' t you cap insurance . . .
beg ##ala mr . palm ##isan ##o , go ahead .
palm ##isan ##o give me a moment , please .
nad ##er go ahead , go ahead .
palm ##isan ##o in california where they have this law , it caps the non - economics , the ones you ca n ' t quan ##tify .
there are awards in 10 million , 20 million , $ 30 million in california for economic .
so all medical ##s , all rehabilitation , care services in the home , lost wages . . .
novak no , no , no .
i ' ve got to ask mr . nad ##er , we are almost out of time .
doug friedman ( ph ) , who ran jesse ventura ' s campaign for governor four years ago , says he wants you to run for president again .
i know you ' re saying it ' s much too early to run for president .
but one simple question , ralph , will you consider another run for president ?
nad ##er much too early to consider .
i am concerned about donald zoo ##k ( ph ) , who ' s head of a medical mal ##pr ##actic ##e insurance company , a big one in the west , saying that his insurance company executive colleagues should not blame the tor ##t injury system .
he said that your problem of jack ##ing up these insurance rates is self - inflicted .
here ' s an insurance company executive who is saying that .
palm ##isan ##o well , mr . zoo ##k is one executive you are quoting .
what we need to do is look at all of the people who do n ' t have doctors . . .
nad ##er hey , let ' s get some agreement .
should we get some agreement ?
palm ##isan ##o what . . .
nad ##er do you want to really crack down on the bad doctors ?
palm ##isan ##o we want to crack down on the attorneys who file fr ##ivo ##lous suits .
nad ##er fine .
fine .
palm ##isan ##o seventy percent of the cases filed are told there ' s no payment .
what kind of peer review is that ?
nad ##er wait .
wait .
do you want to crack down on the bad doctors ?
you ' re in ama .
palm ##isan ##o we definitely want to crack down on bad doctors .
but . . . ( cross ##talk )
nad ##er do you want to control insurance rates ?
palm ##isan ##o we want the free market to di ##cta ##te what is done .

beg ##ala welcome back to cross ##fire .
over in iraq , arms inspectors are discovering and destroying missiles .
spy planes are searching for more banned arms , and iraqi scientists are being interviewed by u . n . weapons inspectors . but here in washington , president bush says it ' s all a hoax , and many believe he has already made up his mind to go to war .
back with us to talk about it , two congress ##men : j . d . hay ##worth , the republican from arizona , and bernie sanders , an independent from vermont .
novak congressman sanders , you ' re opposed to this war .
i ' m not crazy about it myself .
but i want to ask you a question .
when the guns begin to fire , when the american men and women are in harm ' s way and may be dying , is that now the time for you and your allies to shut up and support the troops ?
( applause )
sanders well it ' s not - - are you suggesting that when tens and thousands of iraqi women and children are killed , and when young men and women in this country are un ##ne ##ces ##sari ##ly put at harm ' s risk , what should we do ?
the answer is , these are my neighbors from vermont and obviously we ' re going to support them .
and obviously we ' re going to pray that there ' s fewer casualties . . .
novak are you going to demonstrate against them in the streets ?
sanders no , i do n ' t demonstrate against anybody during a war .
but let ' s be clear . the president almost un ##ila ##tera ##lly is putting us in this position against world opinion .
novak did n ' t the congress support it ?
i thought you voted for it .
sanders i did not vote for it .
novak i mean the congress .
the majority rules .
sanders yes .
the congress gave him authority , but the american people disagreed with the decision .
novak not according to the polls .
sanders not the polls that i have seen .
beg ##ala congressman hay ##worth , back to a comment .
and i know that you meant it and i agreed with it .
you said , " this is saddam hussein , the butcher of baghdad .
" i ' m curious , would that have accurately described him in 1988 ?
hay ##worth oh , yes .
i think it does .
i think it has described him , especially since he ' s taken basically a one - man rule over with the ba ##ath party in 1979 .
beg ##ala i agree .
therefore , was n ' t dick cheney , as the ceo of hall ##ib ##urt ##on , wrong to be selling oil ##field equipment to the butcher of baghdad in 1988 ?
hay ##worth i do n ' t know about any oil equipment going to saddam hussein .
what i do know in the here and now is . . .
beg ##ala i can tell you about it if you like .
hay ##worth that ' s fine .
and i know you ' d love to cloud the issue .
beg ##ala that ' s an important issue to me .
hay ##worth no , it ' s so important - - you know this - - and i know it ' s fun and we love doing partisan punch & judy , but is there ever a time when we stand up even if we respectful ##ly disagree with the commander in chief and those who would wage war ?
dissent is fine , but these cheap shots , i do n ' t know anything about hall ##ib ##urt ##on .
beg ##ala he had $ 73 million worth of ( un ##int ##elli ##gible ) to sell oil ##field equipment to saddam hussein .
( cross ##talk )
hay ##worth what i do know is saddam hussein has butcher ##ed over a million of his own citizens .
and to somehow try to play partisan parlor games may be cute , but we are dealing with a clear and present danger .
beg ##ala would you have treated him as a customer , the way dick cheney did ?
hay ##worth i do n ' t even know about that .
beg ##ala would you have sold oil ##field equipment to him ?
( cross ##talk )
sanders furthermore , the united states supported him in the war against iran .
hay ##worth yes .
hello ?
iran had hostages .
seventy - nine americans were held hostage .
sanders hello ?
hello ?
we ' re talking . . .
( cross ##talk )
sanders what we ' re talking about is the unpredictable nature of war and what could happen in this war .
for example - - wait a second - - in iran , the reason that you had a ##yat ##oll ##ah k ##hom ##ein ##i in power is he over ##th ##rew the shah . you who put the shah in power ?
the united states of america .
hay ##worth oh the evil united states .
sanders but the point is . . .
novak i want to get to that point .
but the problem with k ##hom ##ein ##i was that the guy who he over ##th ##rew was put in power by the united states .
i ca n ' t quite figure that out .
sanders we over ##th ##rew ( un ##int ##elli ##gible ) and put the shah of iran in power . everybody knows that .
the cia did that .
novak but i mean you ' re attacking the cia for putting him in , when it was - - the problem was k ##hom ##ein ##i .
sanders no , the point i made , k ##hom ##ein ##i came about because we put a brutal dictator , the shah of iran , in power .
the point that i am making is you can not . . .
hay ##worth the point you ' re making is blame america first .
sanders no i ' m not .
hay ##worth that ' s what you ' re doing .
sanders you ' re talking about blow ##back .
you do n ' t know what happens when the most powerful nation on earth invade ##s and occupies a muslim nation and kills tens of thousands of people .
hay ##worth we know what happens .
beg ##ala congressman sanders ( un ##int ##elli ##gible ) .
bernie sanders , an independent from vermont , thank you very much .
congressman j . d . hay ##worth , a republican from arizona , thank you both very much .
we will come back to this debate , believe me .
one of our viewers , though , thinks there ' s a sure fire way to get that al qaeda ring leader to talk .
we ' ll let him fire back in a little bit .
but next , out of all of the pictures from this weekend ' s nail bite ##r between j . d . hay ##worth ' s alma mater of ( un ##int ##elli ##gible ) state , and bob novak ' s beloved university of maryland , only one photo is dramatic enough or politically charged enough to be the cross ##fire " picture of the day .

novak question ?
christ ##a demo ##re hi .
i ' m christ ##a demo ##re ( ph ) from mon ##rov ##ia , maryland .
and i ' m curious , how can democrats claim that president bush is ignoring the war on terror if al qaeda ' s second key operative was just caught ?
novak and it also proves you can even chew gum and walk at the same time . does n ' t it show that ?
beg ##ala he can not eat a pre ##tze ##l and watch a football became at the same time .
so i ' m still doubtful of - - no , here ' s why .
this is a serious point and you deserve a serious answer .
the way we caught that guy was by coordinating with our allies .
we now have a foreign policy in iraq that is putting enormous strain on those allies .
the same weekend they arrested the guy , we had . . .
( cross ##talk )
novak we had no part in it .
beg ##ala no , it was a joint effort by pakistan .
why do we want to se ##ver that relationship with this idiot ##ic war in iraq ?
novak we ' re not se ##ver ##ing it - - question .
ben charlton hi .
i ' m ben charlton ( ph ) from east lansing , michigan .
i was - - if we wait for u . n . approval for action in iraq , do n ' t we sacrifice some of our national sovereignty ?
novak well , where are all of the conservative questions ?
we never have conservatives in the audience .
there ' s no question .
i think even paul would agree with me .
the question of whether we go to war or not is strictly a national question .
it ' s not a united nations question .
beg ##ala that is correct .
the president has got all of the legal authorities he needs .
i just pray to god he does n ' t use it .
we need to go to the u . n . because we want to build coalition ##s so we have support around the world and so that we do n ' t have to carry the burden ourselves .
but legally he has no obligation to go back to the u . n . from the left i am paul beg ##ala . goodnight for cross ##fire .

look at latest evidence against iraq ; any hope u . n . , old europe will come around to bush administration ' s way of thinking ?
paul beg ##ala , cnn co - host hello , everybody .
welcome to cross ##fire .
on this ash wednesday , the pope asks catholics to fast for peace and he asks president bush to work for peace , while the white house sends out colin powell to make yet another case for war .
we will debate all of that as well as " vanity fair " ' s latest , stunning revelations about michael jackson .
believe it or not , we got new news on michael jackson .
do you think he really looks like a mummy ?
certainly not a daddy .
but first , our own little moon ##walk across the political landscape , the " cross ##fire political alert .
" the foreign ministers of france , germany and russia today issued a joint declaration that they will not allow a second american - backed resolution to pass the united nations security council .
president bush wants the security council to explicitly author ##ize force against iraq , and his press secretary today remained optimistic that in the end , that ' s just what he ' ll get .
president bush is said to be focusing on one fence - sitting security council member , the african nation of guinea , because he said - - quote - - " i used to have one of their pigs . " so - - ok , i made that up .
he did n ' t say that .
tucker carlson , cnn co - host well , i suspected that .
you know . . .
beg ##ala but they are a swing vote .
guinea is an important swing vote .
carlson as is cameroon .
france and germany are pointing to inspection and saying , look , they ' re working .
we do n ' t need war .
they ' re not pointing out that inspections are working only because there ' s the credible threat of war . saddam would n ' t be destroying missiles unless he thought he was going to be destroyed if he did n ' t .
beg ##ala i think that ' s a good point .
it does n ' t mean we have to go to war .
but i think president bush should get credit for pushing to instructions and backing them up with the threat of force .
carlson it means when you take the threat of force of the table , you ' re likely to stop di ##sar ##ming saddam hussein .
beg ##ala yes , i ' m not saying take the threat of force .
i ' m saying we do n ' t need to use force right now .
carlson well , france and germany would like to .
secretary of state colin powell today responded to saddam hussein ' s latest attempts to fool the world . powell called iraqi steps toward di ##sar ##mament - - quote - - " too little , too late " gestures , meant to split international resolve to force baghdad to give up its weapons of mass destruction .
u . s . intelligence said powell indicates iraq has hidden equipment to produce al - sam ##oud 2 missiles , even as it destroys existing ones , missiles that until recently , it claimed not to have .
powell also revealed that iraq is hiding chemical and biological weapons in poor neighborhoods around baghdad .
in order to secure peace , powell concluded , the international community must confront saddam hussein ' s refusal to di ##sar ##m - - quote - - " here and now .
" so , there you have it .
the essence of the american case for war against saddam hussein .
the only question left : who do you believe ?
secretary of state colin powell or france ?
beg ##ala no , the question is . . .
carlson that is the question .
beg ##ala who do you believe : the bush administration or your lying eyes ?
we are watching them destroy weapons , as the president says , oh , that ' s just a hoax .
carlson but paul . . .
beg ##ala they are di ##sar ##ming .
carlson no , no , no that ' s not what the president ' s saying .
he ' s saying , the - - it ' s a hoax to the extent that those are only a small number of the weapons there .
keep in mind , these are weapons that saddam hussein , until recently , said he did n ' t even have .
he ' s a liar .
beg ##ala of course .
carlson and to trust saddam hussein in effort to di ##sar ##m him - - foolish task , do n ' t you think ?
beg ##ala absolutely .
nobody trusts saddam hussein .
the question is , is he a sufficient threat to america today to risk the lives of our young men and women .
carlson that ' s a separate question .
that ' s a very separate question .
beg ##ala i think he ' s not .
i think the inspections can work .
carlson that ' s a different argument .
we can take it up later .

look at latest evidence against iraq ; any hope u . n . , old europe will come around to bush administration ' s way of thinking ?
beg ##ala well , those of you who still believe the myth of the liberal media should consider this : ms ##nbc , an obscure cable channel , has fired phil dona ##hue , the host of its highest - rated show .
a memo from inside nbc , reported on the web site ally ##our ##tv . com , and today in " the washington post , " shows nbc big wig ##s feared that the liberal mr . dona ##hue represented in the words of the nbc memo - - quote - - " a difficult public face for nbc at a time of war , while our competitors are waving the flag at every opportunity because he seems to delight in presenting guests who are anti - war , anti - bush and skeptical of the administration ' s motives .
" so there it is , according to nbc .
phil dona ##hue was fired because he ' s a liberal .
in fact , the only liberal with the solo cable talk show .
nbc , of course , is a division of the conglomerate ge , where they apparently only bring right wing things to life .
carlson i actually like phil dona ##hue .
i ' ve interviewed him a number of times .
his arguments are really dumb .
i do n ' t know if you ' ve listened to phil dona ##hue .
delightful guy , but his arguments do n ' t make a lot of sense and i think that is the problem with liberal talk show hosts - - you excluded , of course , and james .
but the arguments , actually , do n ' t hold up very well .
have you noticed that ?
beg ##ala you know , you can argue back and forth , but you should n ' t fire someone because of their political views and that ' s what nbc has done and shame on the general electric corporation .
he had the highest - rated show on the network .
carlson which is saying what ?
beg ##ala i used to work there .
they ' re good to me .
they ' re very nice people and they ' re very good to me . . .
carlson ok , ok , i ' m not beat up on ms ##nbc .
beg ##ala . . . but they should n ' t fire a guy for his political views .

carlson former illinois senator carol mo ##sel ##ey - braun recently decided to run for president .
early reviews have not been good , so yesterday she announced she ' ll be making some changes .
not to her ideas , which are few .
not to her record , which is pretty embarrassing .
not even to her staff , which is , of course , tiny .
but to her name .
from here on out , carol mo ##sel ##ey - braun as carol mo ##sel ##ey braun .
did you catch the difference ?
in the second version , there is no h ##yp ##hen between her last names .
mo ##sel ##ey braun expects that primary voters in iowa and new hampshire will react enthusiastically to this radical , grammatical transformation .
they ' ll have to , because the latest cnn poll shows mo ##sel ##ey braun far behind the candidate she set out to disc ##red ##it .
that would be , of course , the honorable al sharp ##ton .
sharp ##ton is not only by far the first choice of black voters nationally , he is tied with senator john edwards among all voters and beating governor howard dean , representative dennis ku ##cini ##ch and senator bob graham .
beating them .
and al sharp ##ton did n ' t even have to change his name .
beg ##ala how did he become honorable ?
carlson yes !
( cross ##talk )
beg ##ala you become honorable by winning an election of some sort or having a high post , being an ambassador or a governor or some thing .
carlson by em ##body ##ing the values of your party .
beg ##ala your values , not mine .
carlson he ' s the no . 1 pick , the most popular , among all candidates , among black primary voters .
i mean , you ca n ' t dismiss him .
he ' s a serious candidate .
beg ##ala we have n ' t even begun the primaries .
he ' s not a serious candidate .
he ' s right wing fantasy and it ' s never going to happen .
carlson not right wing .
take al sharp ##ton seriously , that ' s our message tonight . in a moment , we ' ll ask two members of congress if they ' re convinced that war is the only way to make saddam hussein di ##sar ##m .
later , the pope practices religion and a little anti - war politics on the side .
then , can you spell pro ##st ##hetic nose ?

carlson welcome back to cross ##fire .
france , russia and germany today rest ##ated their opposition to any new u . n . security council that could threaten saddam hussein ' s grip on power .
secretary of state colin powell goes to the u . n . tomorrow to do what he can .
we ' re talking with potential war in iraq with congressman charlie range ##l , a new york democrat and his fellow new yorker republican congressman peter king .
beg ##ala mr . king , thanks for st ##ying with us through the break .
one of the reasons that we like having you on , and as well as mr . range ##l , is that , you know , this is war , as we were saying in the last segment .
you treat it with the gravity and the seriousness that it deserves .
and you ' re a congressman who has put his constituents and his country ahead of his partisan interests .
so i wonder if you ' ll join charlie range ##l , who put out a press release today , dec ##ry ##ing the republican attempt to hi ##jack a bill to help our servicemen to use it to give special interest tax breaks to corporations .
is n ' t that wrong in a time of war ?
king the important thing is that the bill pass for the military .
if the other stuff ' s in there , it ' s there .
i mean to me , the main purpose should be the military .
i ' m not going to disagree with charlie ' s point .
on the other hand , often when bills are passed , there are things attached to them .
so to me , the key thing is that we ought to be taking care of the military and that ' s what we should do .
carlson congressman range ##l , a couple of months ago senator das ##ch ##le on cbs said - - made the charge that we are , quote , " we have n ' t made any real progress in the war against al qaeda .
" a lot of democrats said similar things .
this weekend khalid sha ##ikh mohammed , the no . 2 member of al qaeda and another significant al qaeda member were captured in raw ##al ##pin ##di , pakistan . does n ' t it turn out that mr . das ##ch ##le and others did n ' t know what they were talking about and maybe they should n ' t make charges like that in public when they do n ' t know what they were talking about ?
you would agree with that , would n ' t you ?
range ##l if they do n ' t have the pencil that ' s keeping score , they ought to keep their mouth shut because as a former federal prosecutor , every drug dealer i busted was the most important drug dealer in the world .
you just pass out numbers on whoever you arrest .
why was he no . 3 ?
why was n ' t he no . 4 ?
carlson well , i do n ' t know .
because he helped plan the attack on the world trade center and the pentagon ?
i think that puts you pretty high up in the organization .
( cross ##talk )
range ##l let me tell you , when you arrest somebody , you describe who you ' re arresting .
i have n ' t the slightest clue who this guy was .
carlson i have n ' t heard anybody suggest that he ' s not one of the central figures in al qaeda .
have you ?
range ##l listen , we should be arresting a lot of people .
but i think the main thing that we have now is we should concentrate on os ##ama bin laden , we should concentrate on di ##sman ##tling saddam hussein .
we should do all of those things , but the most important thing is we should not have the arrogance to have a pre ##em ##ptive strike against a defense ##less nation without the . . .
carlson a defense ##less nation ?
they have biological weapons .
how are they defense ##less ?
beg ##ala and how ' d they get them ?
range ##l listen , if this is . . .
carlson it was our fault that they have biological and chemical weapons ?
come on .
range ##l let me tell you .
they have it and we supported them having it when they were fighting iran so it ' s no big deal there .
and the thing is that if we can di ##sar ##m them without actually going there , killing them , i really think that we maintain our moral authority around the world .
we have a lot of people . . .
( applause )
range ##l . . . that have dangerous weapons .
i mean , what happens if india decides that they could have a pre ##em ##ptive strike against pakistan ?
what happens if the north koreans take another look ?
our country is great enough and strong enough to maintain the moral authority to convince the international community that we ' re right .
i do n ' t think we have to kill to prove that .
beg ##ala i ' m sorry to have to do this , but we are out of time .
i want have congressman peter king from new york back on , and congressman charlie range ##l .
thank you both for a very interesting debate .
one of the most admired men in the world is doing everything he can to ave ##rt the horror of war .
in a minute we will look at his holiness , john paul ii ' s efforts to be a peace ##maker .

don from denver , colorado writes , " paul , you keep referencing hall ##ib ##urt ##on selling equipment to iraq " - - which i do .
" i recall , as reported in ' the wall street journal , ' that the transactions were legal .
is it possible that the equipment allowed iraq to produce oil for the oil for food program authorized by the u . n . ? " they were legal because mr . cheney ' s company used a loop ##hole . they went through a foreign subsidiary .
but they did en ##rich saddam hussein and his evil , ruthless regime , and they were im ##moral .
they were wrong .
dick cheney should have never profit ##ed off of doing business with saddam hussein .
carlson i would agree with that .
what does that have to do with the war in iraq ?
beg ##ala it means cheney is a h ##yp ##oc ##rite .
he ' s trying to lead us into a war against one of his valued customers .
carlson well it ' s a complete . . .
( cross ##talk )
carlson you ' re attacking the man .
that ' s irrelevant to the argument .
beg ##ala i ' m attacking his business practices .
carlson no , no , you ' re attacking - - ok great .
that ' s great .
but it has nothing to do whether we should go to war with iraq or not .
beg ##ala well yesterday he was a valued customer , today he ' s an even villain .
( cross ##talk )
carlson right .
so we ' re against dick cheney , but that does n ' t have anything to do with saddam hussein .
chad hen ##sley , from fairfax , virginia , writes , " france , russia and german have all multi - billion dollar oil deals with saddam in iraq .
i wonder why they protest the war with iraq .
it must be the humanitarian reasons . " well , chad , that ' s what liberals assume .
that europe is against the war on humanitarian and moral grounds , but the u . s . is for the war because it wants to profit for the oil companies .
it is a weird assumption , do n ' t you think ?
beg ##ala as you know , i ' ve never said that .
carlson you have n ' t .
beg ##ala i do n ' t believe for a minute that this is a war for oil .
i think it ' s un ##wise , it ' s un ##just , it ' s un ##war ##rant ##ed , but i do n ' t think it ' s about oil . now , the reason that france , russia and germany are against war is because they have demo ##cr ##acies .
the people are against it .
it ' s called democracy .
those leaders are reflecting the views of their people .
carlson they hate america , paul .

christina wright my name is christina wright ( ph ) .
i ' m from minneapolis , minnesota .
and i was just curious if you feel that the attack on iraq would actually open a pandora ' s box in other middle eastern countries that we are known to aid and harbor terrorists , such as syria and iran .
carlson it might .
i mean that ' s absolutely one of the fears .
that it would des ##ta ##bil ##ize the entire region .
on the other hand , the region is pretty unstable , filled with people who already hate americans and seek to do america harm .
so the question is , could it be worse ?
beg ##ala our president believes it will set off a positive domino effect of democracy through the region .

iraq blame ##s market blast on coalition
wood ##ruff we know that some of the american troops now fighting in iraq are longtime veterans of warfare , probably not most , but some .
their military service goes back to the vietnam era .
others , though , are novice ##s .
so what is it like for them to face combat far from home ?
for an idea , here is cnn ' s candy crowley with some war stories .
( begin video ##ta ##pe )
candy crowley , cnn sr . political correspondent ( voice - over ) they are , we are told , well trained .
sen . chuck ha ##gel ( r ) , nebraska this is a messy business .
there ' s nothing very pretty about the training that you take to prepare you for combat , because it is to kill people .
crowley in the spring of 1970 , a squad of u . s . soldiers spotted a small unit of viet cong that had been circling for days .
staff sergeant tom ridge opened fire .
a viet cong soldier dropped dead .
( on camera ) : did you at the time or have you since looked back and pondered on killing someone ?
tom ridge , homeland security secretary mm - hmm .
crowley and what ' s that like ?
ridge that ' s one of those intro ##sp ##ect ##ive times where it ' s just - - it ' s just an intro ##sp ##ect ##ive time , not a public time .
crowley ( voice - over ) duke cunningham was a vietnam fighter ace shooting down five enemy planes .
after his first , he returned to a ship deck full of sailors and crew cheering , shaking his hand , pushing in to slap his back .
rep . randy cunningham ( r ) , california and one of the guys looked at me and says : duke , what ' s it like to kill somebody ?
and , all of a sudden , bang , it just hit me .
you do n ' t think about those things .
and it ' s removed .
it ' s far off .
it ' s not in close . and i went to the priest , because it bothered me .
i knew i could do it again .
but i did n ' t know it was going to bother me as much as it did .
and it still does .
crowley of all the wounds time does not heal , the ones that fest ##er deep in the soul are the wounds you in ##flict .
ridge it ' s not something that civilized people do .
you do n ' t - - it ' s just not - - it ' s not a matter of being tormented , but troubled in the sense that that ' s not what we do , unless we ' re called upon to do it , under the most extreme set of circumstances .
crowley war may sometimes be a necessary thing , but it can never be a natural thing .
training bridges that gap .
sergeant chuck ha ##gel was seriously wounded twice in vietnam .
ha ##gel you are trying to kill people , because the alternative is , if you are in combat , you will be killed .
so your choices are not varied .
it ' s very simple .
and so you do what you ' re trained to do .
you do what you ' re there to do .
and , in vietnam , it was body count .
crowley training is what keeps you running toward the front while trucks loaded with dead bodies pass you , going the other way .
rep . charles range ##l ( d ) , new york it ' s hard to explain what training can do .
training sets your mind to respond not to common sense and judgment , but to training .
you really do n ' t have time to think : i ' m going the wrong way .
i should be going the other way .
crowley later , when he was wounded and trapped behind enemy lines in korea , staff sergeant charlie range ##l led 40 men , fighting their way to safety .
he won a bronze star .
range ##l if you ' re killing people , it ' s out of fear , not really , in my opinion , out of bravery .
nobody is looking for medals .
everyone wants to live another day .
crowley do n ' t mis ##under ##stand .
range ##l , cunningham , ridge and ha ##gel are all proud , decorated combat veterans .
it ' s just , a decade later , killing still troubles the soul .
maybe that ' s a good thing .
( on camera ) : did you do it again ?
cunningham i did .
i shot down four more mig ##s .
and i often told myself - - i said that , if i ever get used to this , i should n ' t be here .

well , as coalition forces push north , they are encounter ##ing a unique problem of combat , getting rid of the weapons captured from the enemy .
some of the 40 , 000 british troops are kicking up a lot of dust in the iraqi desert making sure that nothing is left behind them that could hurt them .
greg mil ##am is with the u . k . forces in southern iraq .

greg mil ##am , cnn correspondent seemingly deserted , these battered buildings hold a deadly threat to british forces in iraq .
sergeant geoff ban ##ham , royal engineers this is what we ' re coming across a lot of these , 30 mil , 60 mil , 80 mil , even 120 mil .
so there ' s plenty still out there that will have to be recovered because they can be used .
mil ##am do you know when this place was last used ?
i mean do you know ( un ##int ##elli ##gible )
ban ##ham i ' m not too sure but judging by some of this , it ' s been here quite a long time so whether it ' s been used recently by them - there was an intel upbeat saying that they were possibly coming back to try and get this to use against them .
mil ##am grenades , mortar ##s , all sorts of ammunition abandoned by iraqi soldiers but there for the taking .
the job of these royal engineers is to clear this and many other mountains of armament ##s and destroy them .
some are too unstable to be moved and have to be blown up on the spot .
the rest is carried way out into the desert .
and today ' s parts in this conflict , this kind of work becomes more and more important .
with the coalition forces moving forward the last thing they want is weaponry like this lurking behind them .
captain andy goo ##ch , royal engineers with the amounts of ammunition and weapons left about , if they ' d used those systems , that amount of weapon it would have given us a considerable amount of trouble trying to take the positions .
mil ##am with much of this weaponry there is only one safe thing to do .
no one in the british forces here is willing to take any risks .

wood ##ruff that ' s something to look at .
today the pentagon is comparing suicide bombing attacks on coalition forces in iraq to terrorism .
four u . s . army soldiers were killed when a suicide bomber attacked a military checkpoint today in na ##ja ##f .
cnn ' s chris plant ##e is chasing all that down for us at the pentagon right now .
hello chris .
chris plant ##e , cnn pentagon correspondent hi , judy .
that ' s right .
four u . s . soldiers from the 3rd infantry division manning a checkpoint near the town of na ##ja ##f killed today in an apparent suicide bombing .
a man driving what appeared to be a taxi ##ca ##b came to the checkpoint , waved soldiers over , appeared to be having mechanical problems of some kind .
as the soldiers approached , the man detonated explosives in the car killing all four of the soldiers .
this is something that iraqi vice president rama ##dan had said would take place .
he said this long before the conflict ever began .
he reiterated today in a press conference in baghdad that this would just be the beginning of this that they would plan on killing thousands of u . s . troops with suicide bombing similar to this .
also , in southern iraq today near bas ##ra , two members - claimed to be members of saddam ' s that ##ae ##en ( ph ) group surrendered to u . s . troops saying that they had been ordered to carry out suicide bombings down there but that they did n ' t want to die for the regime so they were surrender ##ing .
at the pentagon briefing today , general stanley mcc ##hr ##yst ##al said that it looked a lot like terrorism .
mcc ##hr ##yst ##al it looks and feels like terrorism and what it requires is units to conduct forced production activities which they are prepared and do all the time but clearly when you see a tactic like this , it requires strict adherence or adjustments to your tactics , techniques and procedures to ensure that places like checkpoint ##s are not vulnerable .
so it wo n ' t change our overall rules of engagement .
it does n ' t effect the operation at large but to protect our soldiers it clearly requires great care .
plant ##e so certainly an unpleasant development today judy and another item on the dock ##et over here today is the failure of a number of cruise missiles . tom ##aha ##wk land detect missiles being from launched from ships in the eastern mediterranean and in the red sea have suffered a number of failures .
the pentagon says a total of seven of the cruise missiles have failed crashing in turkey and in saudi arabia .
no injuries reported .
the missiles are programmed so that they do n ' t det ##onate until they reach their target .
if they go as ##tray , then the war ##heads never arm but claiming that it ' s about one percent of the war ##heads .
they ' ve fired 67 ##5 or so tom ##aha ##wk land detect missiles from ships and seven of those have failed . judy . . .
wood ##ruff chris , very quickly , new information from the pentagon today about any concerns they have about saddam hussein ' s ongoing air defense capability ?
plant ##e well , no major concern .
the pentagon says that they do have air dominance as they now call it over the vast majority of the country that there are certain areas and only certain areas of downtown iraq where battle management radar ##s linked to surface to air missiles are still in ta ##ct . the reason that they ' re still in ta ##ct according to today ' s briefing was that they had not turned them on and as long as they do n ' t turn them on , the u . s . has trouble locating them .
they assure us that as soon as they do start turning on these radar ##s that they ' ll take those out too and finish the job in terms of airspace over baghdad .
judy . . .
wood ##ruff all right .
we ' re paying attention to all those details for us , chris plant ##e at the pentagon .
you ' re looking at live pictures of baghdad where there have been more strikes , more bombs dropped , more missiles this evening and of course as always , cnn keeping a close eye , a close watch , a close listen on what ' s going on in baghdad .
coming up , coalition forces control several parts of southern iraq but they still face some serious problems including pockets of resistance .
that story when we come back . since marching into iraq , coalition troops have engaged in some fierce battles with saddam hussein ' s forces .
a serious problem they still face though , pockets of resistance .

david bow ##den , cnn correspondent house clearance royal marine style , troops from ( un ##int ##elli ##gible ) commando task to seek out the last pockets of iraqi resistance in umm q ##as ##r go in hard to arrest suspected regime sy ##mp ##athi ##zers and search for weapons .
it ' s not pretty and there ' s no please and thank you but for the marines , every door potentially hides a gun ##man and when your life is on the line , manners go out the window .
the iraqi ##s arrested looked be ##mus ##ed ( ph ) and plead innocence but with many militia here , pretending to surrender only to open fire on their capt ##ors later , first impressions can be dec ##eptive and lethal .
this patrol did find hidden weapons .
they ' re not the first and they ' re unlikely to be the last .
the marines believe they have a firm hold on umm q ##as ##r right now but they ca n ' t afford to slack in their grip and allow those who are hostile to the coalition forces to reg ##roup and begin again their cycle of violence .
the marines with their sniper ##s have now sniper ##s have now spread their area of operations north to include the town of umm ki ##ou ( ph ) .
as in umm q ##as ##r before it , they ' re here to clear out the opponents to regime change .
a man in this vehicle took a pot shot at the commandos .
it was a painful and bloody mistake .
major rob mac ##go ##wan , royal marines we sent in one of our companies of about 100 men in here this morning and we took about 12 or 13 prisoners , three or four enemy were injured and they ' ve now been flown out and we ' re treating them including a man who is almost dead with a gunshot wound to the chest .
we ' ve now evacuated them out and the enemy now have either fled or they ' ve been captured .
bow ##den the royal marines are satisfied they are in control of this small corner of iraq .
their task now is to keep it that way .

wood ##ruff that report filed just a short time ago .
well , cnn analyst ken poll ##ack who is with the center for middle east policy at the brook ##ings institution is with me now .
he is an expert on the iraqi military and its tactics and weapons .
ken poll ##ack , that resistance that we just saw the british troops dealing with , you and i were talking earlier today .
the story the last few days has been the surprising level of resistance but you ' re telling me your sense is that the coalition forces are beginning to adjust to that .
ken poll ##ack , center for middle east policy , brook ##ings institution right .
i mean we ' re seeing one of the great advantages of u . s . and british forces now , judy , which is that they ' re superb ##ly trained troops . they have training in a whole variety of different missions and they ' re adapting .
they recognize now they went in with some false assumptions about the kind of reception that they were going to face .
the plan that was implemented had some inherent risks in it , risks to the supply line , risks in terms of not clearing cities and they ' re shifting .
they ' re changing and the troops are trained well enough to be able to deal with that .
you ' ve seen u . s . central command bringing up additional forces like the 82 ##nd airborne division to better deal with these long supply lines , get control over the cities and so i think that u . s . and british forces are beginning to stabilize the battlefield .
wood ##ruff so as an on ##lo ##oke ##r , as somebody who ' s studied the iraqi capabilities , is it your sense that the coalition can continue to adjust to whatever they deal with ?
poll ##ack absolutely .
one of the things i think we ' re likely to see is that the iraqi ##s are going to have a tough ##er time adapting than u . s . forces are . typically what you ' ve seen in the iraqi armed forces is the change has to come from the top .
it does n ' t come from the ground up .
you do n ' t have ground commanders calling back and saying hey , we ' d like to try this tactic or this seems to work .
tell everybody else to do the same thing . instead the high command has to identify a problem , come up with a solution and transmit it down .
chances are the iraqi ##s are going to continue to stick with what we ' ve seen before , irregular forces blending in with civilians trying to attack u . s . forces , some more of these suicide attacks which are going to be problematic for our troops .
there ' s no way around that but u . s . forces , british forces are beginning to adapt to it .
wood ##ruff i want to ask you about you mentioned coalition forces going in expecting more support from ordinary iraqi people .
i just interviewed a gentleman , native of iraq , who talks to his family there all the time and he says they live in baghdad 20 , 30 , 50 of them and he said they do the view the americans as invaders .
they hate saddam hussein .
they do n ' t like what he ' s doing but they do n ' t think the americans are the answer .
poll ##ack all right .
well , this is something that we ' ve been trying to get a grip on for years , exactly what the iraqi people feel and also that i think the best evidence that we had before the attack began was that iraqi ##s do , they des ##pis ##e .
they are desperate to be rid of him but by the same token , they do n ' t like another country coming into their country to over ##turn the government and beyond that , i think it ' s probably most important for most iraqi ##s is they ' re deeply suspicious of the united states .
they remember that the united states betrayed them in 1991 .
the u . s . did n ' t finish saddam then .
president bush - then president bush called on them to rise up and then the u . s . did nothing and so they ' re deeply suspicious of what we have in mind .
wood ##ruff which raises questions going forward .
one last thing , ken poll ##ack i want to ask about this british officials saying that they have information that saddam hussein has fired his air defense chief .
what ' s the significance of that ?
poll ##ack well , if it ' s true and obviously we do n ' t know just yet but if it ' s true , it is very significant because it ' s effectively the iraqi ##s admitting that many of the civilian casualties that we ' ve seen over the last few days may in fact have been caused by iraqi surface to air missiles falling back to ground in residential areas .
wood ##ruff ( ina ##udi ##ble )
poll ##ack exactly , in that market and i think it was pretty apparent when you looked at the video of that market , if that had been a u . s . bomb or a u . s . cruise missile , that market would have been ob ##lite ##rated .
chances are it was an iraqi surface to air missile .

wood ##ruff we ' re going to go quickly to northern iraq now where we find cnn correspondent ben wed ##eman .
there ' s been some action in that area .
nick ( ph ) -
i mean - i ' m sorry .
ben , we can make you out just barely but tell us what you ' ve been seeing .
ben wed ##eman , cnn correspondent yes .
judy , you ' re seeing us through the night scope because basically for the last hour we ' ve been watching as this ridge behind me in kala ##k which of course is the front line between iraq and kurdish ( ph ) forces , we ' ve been watching as planes , planes we can hear but can not see , have been bombing the ridge line behind us .
five huge explosions within the space of less than an hour as these planes drop these massive bombs on the iraqi positions behind us .
not just iraqi positions behind us , in addition to that in the direction of mo ##sul as well which is a major northern iraqi city about 28 miles to the west of me .
we ' ve also seen some massive blasts to the south as well so it appears that this bombing in this area continues and we have really seen the most intense bombing of the war in this area in the last 24 hours .
judy . . .
wood ##ruff ben , what is your best understanding of what it is on the ground that the coalition forces are going after there ?
wed ##eman well , basically on the ridge itself it is the most forward iraqi army positions and we ' ve been watching them very closely for the last month prior to the war to the outbreak of the war and basically these are the positions that control this entire valley .
up there they have heavy machine guns .
they have mortar ##s .
they have anti - tank guns , hundreds of men along this very long ridge that basically runs from the north to the south .
in addition to that , we know that further back behind those lines in the direction of mo ##sul there is heavy artillery and tanks as well , this according to the people here in this area , the local ku ##rds who have been going across the lines for many years basically engaged in smuggling .
now precisely what they ' re hitting to the south of us is unclear but my understanding is that there are further iraqi positions in that direction as well .
judy . . .
wed ##eman ben wed ##eman describing coalition hits in the area where he is , the town of kala ##k in northern iraq .
he just called in and we wanted to get this report to you right away .
ben , very - we thank you very much for that and we ' ll be coming back to you as the night - as the night wears on .
we ' re getting close to the bottom of the hour .
we ' re going to get some headlines at the hour right now with heidi collins .

wood ##ruff i hope they get a little rest .
when we come back , one of the many sad aspects of this war , humanitarian aid rushed to people who need it but not everybody gets what they came for .
slowly humanitarian aid is rolling into southern iraq but dramatic scenes like this one of a crowd tearing into the supplies on a convoy truck only under ##sco ##res how desperate the need is .
correspondent martin ge ##iss ##ler files this report from the iraqi town of sa ##f ##wan .
( begin video ##ta ##pe )
martin ge ##iss ##ler , cnn correspondent as our convoy rolled through southern iraq the desperation of the people here soon became evident .
in trucks and on foot they came to the town of sa ##f ##wan .
these people have been without food or water supplies since the war began .
now they are desperate .
within seconds the kuwait ##i aid workers who had organized this trip were over ##powered by the mob .
these desperate scenes are exactly what the aide agencies wanted to avoid .
this is survival of the fit ##test .
only the healthy and strong can get to the food . the weak and the ill are left with nothing .
despite this effort to help the iraqi people , resentment is never far away .
unidentified male we hate u . s . we hate british , england .
we hate any state in war here .
ge ##iss ##ler what do you think about saddam ' s regime ?
unidentified male saddam ' s very good man .
ge ##iss ##ler as the supplies ran out the mood swung from frantic to ugly .
delivery drivers were threatened .
one of the buses in our convoy was held up at knife ##point .
the troops have moved into sa ##f ##wan .
we , as a consequence , have had to move out .
it ' s simply too dangerous .
this is a clear indication that despite the coalition re ##ass ##urance ##s that this part of iraq is safe and despite the aid being brought into the people here , it is still a very , very volatile area .
tonight here the strong are eating .
the weak still go hungry .

wood ##ruff so many different pictures we are getting from across that country .
well , they are making their voices heard at home and abroad .
when we return , americans this weekend are marching against the war and in support of the troops .
we ' ll check out some of the demonstrations .
here in the united states this weekend just as they did last weekend , anti - war protesters taking to the street .
in los angeles , the international black coalition for peace and justice is sponsoring a rally for peace today . congress ##woman maxi ##ne waters was among those scheduled to attend .
in the meantime further north in california , san francisco is the setting today for a rally aimed at boost ##ing the moral of the american troops in the persian gulf region .
cnn ' s rusty do ##rn ##in is with us from san francisco . rusty , what sort of crowd is showing up there ?
rusty do ##rn ##in , cnn correspondent well judy , this is the largest group really we ' ve seen of the support the troops rallies that have been over the last few weeks .
of course this is the home of the anti - war demonstrations stemming back to the vietnam war but there are close to between 500 and 1 , 000 people .
i ' m getting various estimates on the crowd .
we did want to show you an interesting thing here .
some folks are showing some solidarity with the speakers here . you ' re looking at some of san francisco ' s police department ' s officers .
i did ask them why they did that .
they said they were wearing skull ##cap ##s so they decided to adopt this to show solidarity .
they said the department has not made any statement about whether they think that ' s all right or not .
this has been a very peaceful demonstration .
as i said , the officers did tell me that this is the largest pro - troops demonstration that has ever been in san francisco since the vietnam war .
so far , very peaceful . as i said , there have been a few verbal exchanges but one of the most enthusiastically received speakers here was be ##ssa ##m al - hu ##sai ##ni , an iraqi american .
he ' s with the iraqi american council .
how do you feel about supporting the troops ?
how does the iraqi american council feel ?
be ##ssa ##m al - hu ##sai ##ni , iraqi american council well the iraqi american have been waiting for this liberation and they want to get rid of saddam so bad and they will have to take it the way it ' s been offered to us .
do ##rn ##in how do you feel though seeing pictures of civilians injured in the bombings ?
al - hu ##sai ##ni we get reports that these civilians especially in the ( ina ##udi ##ble ) population have been attacked by the iraqi regime themselves so they ca n ' t blame the american and said look what the american doing to us .
he would love to see this and would draw on this emotion from the arab world and the european country .
do ##rn ##in now you said you did talk to your family in baghdad as well and they also are somewhat suspicious of the americans .
al - hu ##sai ##ni well , i mean the iraqi people have been the primary victim from the whole thing .
yeah my family , you know , still in fear .
you know they stay in one room .
they boarded all the - all the windows and they built with a brick one of the windows facing the street .
i mean yes , you know , my prayer to them but we can only do so much .
hopefully it will be a short war .
it will be attack the iraqi regime .
we can live in liberty and freedom soon .
do ##rn ##in now i understand some of the people here have been threatened by anti - war protesters .
have you had anyone either threatening you or . . .
al - hu ##sai ##ni no , no problem .
this has been a very peaceful demonstration .
do ##rn ##in ok .
thank you very much .
al - hu ##sai ##ni thank you .
do ##rn ##in be ##ssa ##m al - hu ##sai ##ni here and it has been a very peaceful demonstration .
it is wrapping up this afternoon and it looks like the civil di ##so ##bed ##ience acts by the anti - protesters are scheduled to get underway once again next week .

wood ##ruff it was in northern iraq today that an eight artillery round hit the site occupied by kurdish fighters near cha ##mc ##ham ##al .
it happened near an area abandoned earlier by iraqi forces .
cnn ' s kevin sites is in northern iraq .
( begin video ##ta ##pe )
kevin sites , cnn correspondent this is the road to kirk ##uk .
a day ago it was controlled by iraqi troops and packed with these land mines but now we can drive far enough to see the outskirts of kirk ##uk .
that ' s because coalition fighter jets pu ##mmel ##ed this iraqi position on the hills above cha ##mc ##ham ##al and iraqi troops made a hasty retreat .
this is what the hilltop looks like now , craters 15 feet deep , busted bunker ##s and twisted metal , scattered ammunition ##s and ta ##ttered clothing , a helmet , a tube of tooth ##pas ##te .
kurdish pe ##sh ##mer ##ga fighters took their place .
i ' m glad to see them go this one says .
they killed a lot of our people in cha ##mc ##ham ##al but i feel bad for them too . some of them were only con ##script ##s .
some ku ##rds took advantage of the iraqi retreat right away .
this one took a bull ##do ##zer to a concrete portrait of saddam hussein .
it took about 20 minutes but finally it came top ##pling down .
he says after finishing the job he hopes saddam hussein himself will fall too but despite the ex ##uber ##ance of ku ##rds in the area , it ' s clear it ' s much too early to celebrate .
although the iraqi ##s retreated from this area , at dusk they fired what observers say were seven artillery rounds back at their former stronghold creating new fear and potentially new casualties .

war in iraq
( begin video ##ta ##pe )
walter rodgers , cnn sr . international correspondent ( voice - over ) the situation here appears to be increasingly tense .
a few moments ago , out on the horizon , not very far ahead of the u . s . army ' s 3rd squadron , 7th cavalry , we heard more than a few explosions .
the u . s . army ' s 3rd squadron , 7th cavalry has compiled a rather extraordinary record in the past several days .
it was the first unit to cross the eu ##ph ##rates river and then punch northward to within 60 miles of baghdad .
it was the army which assigned me to the 3rd squadron , 7th cavalry , and that was extremely fort ##uit ##ous .
it was like sitting in a poker game and drawing four aces , because this is a crack unit .
it ' s the tip of the tip of the spear .
we ' ve had an absolutely terrific story , pushing forward north toward baghdad . seventy - two hours of that was under constant fire coming at us from both sides of the road .
unidentified male we just heard an incoming - - what the hell !
unidentified male no , no , i do n ' t know what it is .
rodgers recall winston churchill ' s old quote , " there ' s nothing so ex ##hila ##rating as being shot at and missed .
" what you try to do is stay calm and continue your broadcasting .
the worst thing you can do , either as a soldier or as a war correspondent is panic .
we ' re hearing incoming .
we ' re not sure what it is .
we see some stuff in the sky .
we may have to break this off .
i think we ' re going to break off this live shot for the time being .
we ' re not sure what we see up there .
goodbye .
we ' ve got to dive for vehicles , we think .
see you .
bye .
we have under heavy fire for the past couple of miles .
mostly small arms fire , but the sand storm has enabled the iraqi ##s to come very close to the road , and if i sound a little nervous , it ' s because we ' re in the soft skin vehicle and everybody else is in armor . we ' d like to now show you what we call old betsy ( ph ) , a re - used , second ##hand u . s . army hum ##ve ##e that we ' ve been traveling with .
any bullet will pass through it , even a . 22 caliber bullet .
you can see our body armor draped on the door .
this is what we ' ve literally been living in . this is the kitchen , when we ' re down , and we ' re very fortunate , because we ' ve got a tea ##pot .
that ' s my cub ##by hole .
it ' s extraordinary cramped , because ( un ##int ##elli ##gible ) sand ##bag the floor , in case we hit a mine .
that ' s all the space i have to eat and sleep in .
you do n ' t sleep .
you really do n ' t sleep out here .
of course , you ' re on an adrenaline high , but racing across the desert , you know that you ' re traveling toward the jaws of what could be a major military battle .
you have to realize , they ' ve been riding along , bouncing along in these tanks for probably six or more hours now .
and if you ride inside that tank , it is like riding in the bow ##els of a dragon .
they roar , they sc ##ree ##ch .
the hardest part of the trip is personal discomfort .
we can not tell you the levels of personal discomfort we ' ve experienced .
the extraordinary sands ##torm ##s , the bitter cold nights .
the most uncomfortable thing is having to sleep sitting up in a hum ##ve ##e with sand ##bags under your feet , your knees at your chin . that ' s ex ##cr ##uc ##iating ##ly uncomfortable , not something that you would wish on anybody but a con ##tort ##ion ##ist .
let me give you an example of what the dust like .
look at this .
we have been through days of dust like that .
the u . s . army ' s 7th cavalry has just taken three iraqi prisoners of war .
actually , they ' re very close , that is to say , no more than 40 yards away , but the dust and sand are blowing so badly you ' re getting these vague images . it ' s like being in a blizzard , except unfortunately , the sand does n ' t melt as the snow does .
what we eat is what the army calls mr ##es , meals ready to eat .
and i must say , they ' re pretty dar ##n good .
and of course , everybody fights for the best ones .
the treats are things like the m & amp ; ms and the breakfast toast ##ies .
the army is eating much , much better than the grandfather ##s of these soldiers did and the great grandfather ##s of these soldiers in the second world war .
let me hold the camera and show you my crew .
on camera left is charlie miller ( ph ) , he ' s been our superb and int ##re ##pid camera ##man .
on my right is jeff bar ##wei ##s ( ph ) , a brilliant satellite engineer .
that ' s the crew which really brings you these pictures .
the pictures you ' re seeing are absolutely phenomena ##l .

kelly wallace , cnn correspondent ( on camera ) it had been very quiet inside israel since the start of the u . s . - led war against iraq .
many israelis were fearing that quiet would come to an end . and it did on this day .
police say a suicide bomber blew himself up outside this cafe , called the london cafe , earlier sunday afternoon .
we can show you some pictures from earlier sunday .
people here tell us the cafe was filled with people enjoying the spring weather .
many here though say they are relieved only one person dead , the suicide bomber .
dozens , though , injured , including some israeli soldiers , because according to an eye ##wi ##tness , he said many soldiers were here also enjoying the spring weather .
unidentified male then it was big bomb .
and many soldier .
two soldiers were down here .
many blood .
many people skip from here .
big paranoia .
wallace there had been many terrorist attacks here in net ##any ##a , including the dead ##liest suicide bombing ever in israel almost exactly a year ago , march 27 , at the park hotel during pass ##over , 29 people killed in that attack . as for this attack , the palestinian militant group islamic jihad is claiming responsibility .
according to a leaf ##let from the group obtained by cnn , the group says the attack was to show the union of palestinians with the people of iraq .
the group is also claiming that islamic jihad militants are already inside iraq to carry out attacks against u . s . and british forces .
israel has been on a heightened state of alert since the start of the u . s . - led war against iraq .
and now many israelis fear they could see more attacks like the one they saw here today as the military campaign against saddam hussein continues .

thanks very much .
well , at the pentagon briefing this afternoon , officials describing several units of the republican guard as effectively no longer being a credible fighting force .
let ' s get the very latest from the pentagon for the overall war picture as they see it .
our jamie mcintyre our senior military affairs correspondent is with us now .
hello , again , jamie .
jamie mcintyre , cnn s ##nr . military affairs correspondent well judy , the pentagon is beginning to see positive signs that it had n ' t seen for awhile .
first of all , as we saw just a few moments ago on cnn , the pictures of some of the actual happy iraqi citizens welcoming u . s . troops , that taking place in na ##ja ##f .
also the pentagon is seeing lighter than expected resistance indicating at least that they may have really seriously degraded those republican guard divisions before the u . s . troops arrived , both in ka ##rba ##la and also in al ku ##t .
they met lighter than expected resistance .
but the pentagon officials stress that as they close in on baghdad , this becomes the real dangerous part as they enter that so - called red zone where saddam hussein is believed to have given his commanders authority to use chemical weapons , and that use of chemical weapons remains a real fear at the pentagon .
( begin video clip )
major general stanley mcc ##hr ##yst ##al , joint chiefs , vice dir . we are not expecting to drive into baghdad suddenly and seize it in a coup de main ##s , or anything like that .
so , in regard to that , we are paying great attention to their ability to defend on the ground .
they may just suddenly be effective on the ground .
additionally , their ability to use chemical and biological weapons , they ' ve proven it historically .
we believe they have the capability now .
clearly , as we threaten the core of the regime , which baghdad and ti ##kr ##it represent , we believe that the likelihood of them using those weapons goes up .
( end video clip )
blitz ##er in less than 24 hours , the u . s . 101 ##st airborne division has driven iraqi fed ##ay ##een fighters from the key city of na ##ja ##f , pushed north in a several - pro ##nged attack .
the army ' s 3rd infantry has punched through ka ##rba ##la , meeting only light resistance from the medina republican guard , and moving along highway nine within 25 miles of baghdad .
at the same time , the marines from the 1st division have secured a key ti ##gr ##is river crossing near al ku ##t and reported to have essentially destroyed the combat fighting ability of that light infantry baghdad division that was supposed to be providing defense down there .
at the u . s . central command briefing this morning at the forward headquarters in doha , qatar , general vincent brooks said that the u . s . would be continuing to approach baghdad .
he said , quote , " the dagger is clearly pointed at the heart of the regime now , and it will remain pointed at it , " he said , " until the regime is gone . " judy .
wood ##ruff jamie , these descriptions of the weakening of the republican guard begin to bring back memories of the first gulf war 12 years ago .
is there a chance that coalition forces could , at this point , be over ##est ##imating the strength of what ' s left of the opposition ?
mcintyre well , they might be .
and that might be a good thing .
they are taking it very cautiously .
no one , again , they stress the most dangerous part of this could be ahead .
could be urban combat .
could involve chemical weapons .
could be the most loyal fighters left as they draw into baghdad . could be a very dangerous time .
they also are careful to point out that even while they say that the division has been destroyed , they do n ' t mean every single person has been killed .
simply that its combat effectiveness has been eliminated - judy .
wood ##ruff we notice they said they did not want to use the word destroyed , in fact , they said let others do that .

wood ##ruff u . s . forces moving ever closer to baghdad , but military officials say they are not counting on cap ##it ##ulation .
for a look at what might lie ahead for u . s . forces , let ' s turn to our miles o ' brien in atlanta .
miles o ' brien , cnn anchor thank you very much , judy .
to help guide us through all this discussion about red zones , and daggers and exactly what is the strength of the republican guard , we turn to colonel patrick lang .
he ' s retired with the united states army .
he spent some time in the defence intelligence agency , among other things .
colonel , good to have you with us .
col . pat lang ( re ##t , ) , u . s . army you ' re welcome .
o ' brien what do you suppose right now would be the governor on the forward advance ?
is it the republican guard or is it the u . s . and coalition supply lines ?
or both ?
lang well , they are close enough up to baghdad now so that the supply line issue is probably not a big one since they had time to rest ##ock , food , fuel and ammunition .
so , probably the main thing is comb ##ing through the rubble that the air force has left of these republican guard divisions to make sure there are no strong points that you leave behind , that could threaten your lines of supply once they get past .
once they are satisfied they are through all that , i would imaging there will be a pause while they start to rec ##on ##no ##iter into baghdad , probing hard to see how much resistance there really is .
o ' brien well , let me ask you that .
first of all , i just wanted to tell viewers where we just took our satellite imagery .
this is that ka ##rba ##la area which is about 50 miles from baghdad .
baghdad is roughly in that direction from there .
we know the vanguard is supposedly as close as 15 miles .
one of the next key points along the way here is saddam international airport . do you suppose that is a key target right now ?
lang oh , i ' m sure it is .
i mean a feature of that importance would always be something you ' d want to hold .
and besides , as soon as you get control of it you ' d be able to start using it for air operations , and put a survey team in there as soon as it ' s secured , and then start using it for helicopter operations , haul forward some big bladder ##s of fuel to ref ##uel helicopters and rear ##m them and things like that .
and if the front stabilize ##s between there and the downtown baghdad , they ' ll start using it for a fixed wing aircraft as well .
o ' brien now , as you go from saddam international airport into town you see there are some big , wide divided highways there .
control of these highways will be crucial wo n ' t it ?
lang yeah , these are the high - speed approaches into the heart of the city and armored forces like the 3rd mechanized infantry division just love high - speed approaches .
they will try to go down those things , cutting the city up into sectors as best they can , and then work on the specific sectors of the city they think are a key terrain .
i would think , probably , various facilities as well as major government buildings that they need to control to set up a new government .
o ' brien it ' s a big city , about the size of philadelphia or there ##ab ##outs .
some have said chicago is a good analogy .
tremendous amount of force needed to control a city of that source , or am a wrong ?
lang well , it depends on the attitude of the populous , which is not clear yet . if the population , in fact , or at least a big part of them like the shia half of the population , if they want to be liberated , then you can control them with a fairly small force .
if , in fact , a lot of people in the city do n ' t want to be liberated and you ' re never going to know that until you try , then you ' re going to need a much larger force , and we might end up waiting a couple of weeks for reinforcements .
o ' brien based on what you ' ve seen so far , what is your sense of that ?
the shia ##s are a bit gun shy , if you will , in the south because of what happened in 1991 .
they rose up , did n ' t get american support .
do you suppose it will be a different story in baghdad ?
is there a lot of late ##nt hatred for saddam hussein that will come out ?
lang yes , there is , but these folks are going to be mighty cautious .
they have a long history of being kicked around by the sunni arab population of central iraq .
and they do n ' t have any particular reason to trust us , so far .
so they ' ll wait and see what happens .
it ' s the other people in the city you have to worry about , who are ethnic ##ally much the same as the saddam hussein regime .
and their behavior right now is unpredictable .
o ' brien colonel patrick lang , retired , united states army , thanks for your insights .
a man who has been to baghdad many times and can tell us with great knowledge exactly what it ' s going to be like to fight on those avenues in that sprawling city of baghdad - judy .
wood ##ruff always helps miles to hear a voice of experience .
thank you and thanks to colonel lang .

that means stocks were up today on wall street as they look at the progress of the war in iraq .

wood ##ruff as coalition forces push ahead in their march toward baghdad , they have encountered some resistance in the shi ##ite holy city of ka ##rba ##la .
but american troops and their superior technology have turned out to be a key factor in the fighting there .
and to the south , british forces continue their attack on targets around bas ##ra .
it ##n correspondent tim e ##wart reports .
( begin video ##ta ##pe )
tim e ##wart , it ##n correspondent these are soldiers of the u . s . 3rd infantry , fighting near ka ##rba ##la , southwest of baghdad .
they are facing saddam hussein ' s republican guard , his finest soldiers .
but for all the resistance , coalition aircraft rule the skies and coalition technology is overwhelmingly superior .
u . s . commanders believe the republican guard is a doomed force .

there is much fear here of the saddam loyalists who still hold sway in bas ##ra and of the invading troops waiting at the gates .

( news ##break )
wood ##ruff with u . s . forces rolling closer and closer to baghdad , the military seems to be zero ##ing in on the ground war .
but , as it has from the beginning , air power remains an important part of the battle .
let ' s check in with cnn ' s gary tu ##chman at an air base near iraq .
gary you ' ve seen it first ##hand from the first moments .
gary tu ##chman , cnn correspondent well , that ' s right , judy .
in two weeks after the air war began , there is no let - up and no effective response from the iraqi ##s .
according to the air force , at any given time , there are more 200 coalition aircraft either over iraq , flying to iraq or flying from iraq .
we come to you from a base near the iraqi border .
many pilots are flying these a - 10 attack planes behind me .
they also fly f - 16 ##s .
there are also marine fa - 18 ##s and marine her ##iers at this base .
we can tell you that a lot of pilots of this base are not flying to another base in iraq .
it ' s a base that was taken over by the coalition last week .
and we spent part of the day at that base . and when you arrive there , you are greeted in a sense by saddam hussein .
( begin video ##ta ##pe )
tu ##chman this is tal ##il , iraq .
the tal ##il air base .
but the are no more iraqi ##s here , the coalition took over this base last week .
it ' s now a major staging point .
you know you are in iraq when you drive down the road coming into the base and see the portrait of saddam hussein .
what ' s happen is the military personnel who have arrived here have taken out their markers and are writing messages on saddam hussein ' s portrait .
you can see the main one here on the bottom and also here messages like , we won , april 1 , 2003 .
want to give you a look .
there ' s a lot of security personnel here . you can look over there and you can see the military vehicles .
these are air force security forces with their rifles patrolling the entrance . there is a lot of fighting in this area .
we ' re near the town of nas ##iri ##ya . but this base now is considered secure enough to make it a major staging point for the coalition .
( end video ##ta ##pe )
tu ##chman a short time ago we talked to a pilot at this base who has been to that iraqi base and he too says he has signed that mural right on saddam hussein ' s sash .
after he told us that , we asked him during his missions , and he ' s flown about 30 in the last two weeks , we asked him does he still have any artillery being fired at him ?
( begin video clip )
unidentified male yesterday i was up just south of baghdad by 30 miles and we were fighting sa - 2 ##s and sa - 6 ##s and aaa on the ground .
so they ' re still out there .
but the air power and the air package that we take to the fight , we continue to be effective .
and we at ##tri ##t the medina forces down to less than 50 percent .
and when we put our power punch to them and then the army and the marines move forward it ' s a very effective , coordinated effort .
( end video clip )
tu ##chman lieutenant colonel webb ( ph ) is telling us he has a mission this very evening .
we want to tell you the air force has just informed us that between this morning and tomorrow morning , it will fly 1 , 900 sort ##ies into iraq .
a total over the last two weeks now of close to 24 , 000 sort ##ies . before we go , one more thing we want to tell you about , super ##sti ##tions . military people are very super ##sti ##tious , like many of us are .
here at this particular base they get their mr ##es , their mr ##es are their meals ready to eat .
they come in a bag .
and when you get an mr ##e you get your meal and you get a little treat with it .
what a lot of people here at this base do , when their treat happens to be this one , this is the candy called charms , many of the people refuse to eat their charms .
they consider it a good luck charm to keep their charms in their clothes and not to eat them .
so one little super ##sti ##tious tale for you , judy .
back to you .
wood ##ruff well , i ' m one of those who thinks that we need to pay attention to our super ##sti ##tions .
gary , one another quick question for you .
that air base that coalition forces have now taken control of near nas ##iri ##ya .
are you able to say , are they actually using it or getting much use out of it ?
tu ##chman what they are doing , judy , some of these a - 10 ##s behind me go there to ref ##uel , to stage operations further north .
they also fly these h ##h - 60 helicopters , they ' re the search and rescue helicopters used in case they have to search and find somebody on the ground .
they stage there and ref ##uel .
but right now , none of them are permanently based there , although the plan is for that to eventually happen .
wood ##ruff all right , gary tu ##chman with some charms .
you saw him holding it .
i will be talking with a ranking member of the senate foreign relations committee , senator joe bid ##en , just ahead , for his take on how the war is going .

iraqi ##s mistakenly believe soldiers have sights on sacred landmark
wolf blitz ##er , cnn anchor thanks very much , judy .
with the power out now in baghdad , we ' re getting word that loud ##sp ##eak ##ers have been b ##lar ##ing in the iraqi capital , urging citizens to go to the international airport there , presumably to defend it against coalition forces .
now that armored columns of u . s . - led troops have reached the outskirts of baghdad , eye ##wi ##tness ##es report fighting and shell ##ing around saddam hussein international airport .
in the final push to baghdad , u . s . forces face limited resistance from iraqi troops .
but the pentagon believes some iraqi republican guard units have withdrawn to the capital for what could be their last stand .
farther south in bas ##ra , smoke rose over the city as coalition vehicles moved in today .
british forces say they ' re con ##sol ##ida ##ting their position in bas ##ra ' s key suburbs . and in northern iraq , kurdish political leaders and members of the iraqi opposition are engaged in talks with u . s . military commanders .
they reportedly are exploring the option of joining forces against saddam hussein .
coalition forces launched their latest advances toward baghdad in the pre - dawn hours today , heading toward the iraqi capital from the southeast and the southwest .
the forces encountered limited resistance along the way and are now poised for the final assault not far from the edge of the city .
reporter carl din ##non of britain ' s it ##n filed this report .
( begin video ##ta ##pe )
carl din ##non , it ##n correspondent ( voice - over ) baghdad is now within striking distance as troops make their final thrust through the desert .
wrecked armor by the sides of the road suggests there has been some iraqi opposition .
but by and large , the republican guard has either been destroyed or has withdrawn .
and the way seems to be open for coalition forces to close in on the city ' s southern limits .
at day ##break , u . s . troops pushed through the outskirts of ka ##rba ##la on the road to baghdad , capturing a key bridge on the eu ##ph ##rates river .
meanwhile , coalition commanders posted american special forces were now operating at will .
these dramatic pictures show a raid on a presidential palace less than 60 miles from baghdad .
it seems to have been abandoned , but the united states said it was still on the trail of saddam and his closest circle .
brig . gen . vincent brooks , u . s . central command we remain cautiously optimistic .
we do n ' t think that the fighting is over yet , and so there are still options available to the regime , including the use of weapons of mass destruction .
we take that very seriously .
we take it in a sober fashion .
and at the same time , we remain prepared to continue operations .
din ##non the americans say they ' ve destroyed two divisions of the elite republican guard .
( on camera ) : the medina division , which is one of the tough ##est outfits in the republican guard is now down to 10 percent of its fighting strength .
that means it ' s practically in ##oper ##ative .
others are down to 50 percent , but there ' s still one or two divisions around 75 , 80 , 90 percent of their fighting strength , and they could still put up very stiff resistance , indeed , when the american forces get en mass ##e to baghdad itself .
( voice - over ) : the no ##ose appears to be tightening on saddam hussein .
the question is , how desperate he will get before he is finally toppled .

let ' s listen .
greg lynch sr . , jessica lynch ' s father good afternoon .

d . lynch we talked to her before the surgery , we talked to her after the surgery , and she ' s doing good .
ca n ' t you think ?
g . lynch yes , a bunch , but my mind ' s blank .
the doctor has completed one surgery on her back .
they have released the pressure on a nerve , and real ##ign ##ed all the disks and put plates and stuff in it , and that was because she did n ' t have any feeling in her feet .
so he , he ' s pretty sure right now that that will relieve , relieve the tension , and her feet will be able to move .
also , we have heard and seen reports that she had multiple gunshot wounds , and knife stabbing .
the doctor has not seen any of this .
he looked for the gunshot wounds for the knife stabbing , and there is no injury whatsoever .
they will do surgery again tomorrow on her legs .
she has fractured legs and her right forearm .
and we are just waiting to get that good news too .
d . lynch we talked to her before and after the surgery , like i said , and she ' s just , she just sounded real good .
of course , this morning she was a little gr ##og ##gy .
but yet , she was good , because it was early .
and then this afternoon , after the surgery , she was our jessie again .
question if those were n ' t gunshot wounds to cause the broken bones , do they know what caused the fractures ?
g . lynch they have no idea at this time what caused them .
we know she ' s in good spirits , because they told her they was go ##n na put pink casts on her legs and arms , and she had pink casts when she was in the third grade on her arm so we know she - - her mind is working good .
so she ' s in good spirits , and we hope the surgery will go good tomorrow , just as well as it did today .
question can you tell us what she said to you on the telephone ?
you said she was in good spirits ?
can you describe your conversation ?
g . lynch i teased her again about the army jeep ##s and she said , " i know where there ' s a bunch of that we can find . " so , we know she ' s in good spirits .
d . lynch she was asking for a hair ##brush .
wood ##ruff gregory lynch , the father of jessica lynch , and jessica ' s mother talking to reporters , saying they have talked to her today , both before and after surgery , that she says she ' s feeling good .
they say she will be good .
but they said the doctors did go in and apparently do some work on her spinal cord or spinal column .
he said to relieve some pressure on a nerve .
they were concerned because she did n ' t have feeling in her feet .
they did go on to say the doctors could not find either bullet or knife entry wounds , suggesting that her broken bones came from some other source , and it is not clear yet .
her parents said they do n ' t know yet what caused their daughter ' s injuries .

armed coalition soldiers moving toward a ve ##ner ##ated mosque at the request of a muslim cleric , but angry locals who did n ' t understand what they were trying to do .

the search turns up nothing .
the only resistance comes from a volvo .

this man agrees to be interviewed as long as his face is n ' t shown .

the troops also keep their distance .

do n ' t know who ' s who .
chi ##lco ##te sergeant rod sutton from indiana on the corner of a street leading to the highly sensitive imam ali shrine , one of the ho ##liest sites in the world for shia muslims .
does it make you nervous that you ' re so close to the ali mosque ?
do you feel like you ' re tram ##ping on .

sutton to some extent , i feel fortunate that i ' m here , because this is something i never would have seen before .
and now that i see it i kind of understand some of the history behind it .
so , it makes me more app ##re ##cia ##tive of it .
to the same extent , i do n ' t want to be invasive with these people here .
i do n ' t want to tram ##ple on their holy ground , and i want to respect that as much as i can .
chi ##lco ##te word comes from the grand a ##yat ##oll ##ah sis ##tani that he ' s willing to meet the american commander , but he asks first for soldiers to secure his compound , located halfway down the road to the mosque .
no one explains that to the crowd .
( on camera ) : there is no more striking example of the sen ##sit ##iv ##ities that the u . s . soldiers face here than what is taking place on the streets right up from the ah ali mosque right now .
( voice - over ) : chaos as the crowd apparently believes the soldiers want to approach the shrine .

they do everything soldiers can to appear less hostile .
but the potential for confrontation remains .

well , u . s . officials are investigating two possible friendly fire incidents in which coalition forces may have mistakenly shot at allied aircraft .
in one of the incidents , a soldier was killed and several others wounded .
before word of that death , 40 americans had been killed by hostile fire in operation iraqi freedom .
eleven of them by friendly fire or in other accidents . most of the 27 british troops killed have been victims of friendly fire or accidents .
meantime , iraq says that 420 civilians , they say , have been killed during the war .
and they say 4 , 000 injured .
u . s . officials say more than 4 , 000 iraqi ##s have been captured .
seven americans we know remain prisoners of war in iraq .
fifteen others are said to be still missing in action .
well , when they do finally enter baghdad , u . s . and coalition troops could face urban combat with the republican guard , some of whom may have withdrawn into the city .
but the u . s . military is expecting to remain focused on specific targets in the iraqi capital .
nevertheless , cnn ' s miles o ' brien is with our military analyst , lieutenant colonel robert leonard , he is a persian gulf war veteran and a military science professor at west virginia university - - miles .

iraqi ##s mistakenly believe soldiers have sights on sacred landmark
miles o ' brien , cnn correspondent thanks very much , judy .
and colonel leon ##hard , we ' re going to talk a little bit about urban combat .
and i wanted to just start this off by saying a lot of people when they hear about urban combat , they think of that black ##hawk down scenario , mo ##ga ##dis ##hu and the problems that can go wrong here .
this is not probably a comparable situation , is it ?
lt . col . robert leon ##hard , u . s . army ( re ##t . ) not in any way .
and one of the reasons is because we have armored fighting vehicles there in baghdad , and we will use them .
those tanks have 120 - mill ##imeter smooth ##bor ##e gun on them .
the bradley ##s have 25 - mill ##ime ##tre chain guns and coa ##xia ##l machine guns .
that ' s a lot of mobile protective gunfire .
completely different from the mo ##ga ##dis ##hu situation in which we did not have such vehicles .
and we also are not going to use similar tactics there .
we are much more likely to use patience and fines ##se rather than assault tactics .
o ' brien all right .
we want to show you an animation , and share with our viewers , maybe you can point out a few things about this .
if we move in on baghdad , and give you a sense of the kinds of targets that might be encountered in urban combat .
what we ' ve depicted here is something here which shows some armor sort of off the wings here , right over here is a mosque .
we depict that to show that ' s something you obviously want to stay clear as we just saw with the ryan chi ##lco ##te piece from na ##ja ##f .
as we get a little bit closer here , in a typical scenario like this , you might very well have republican guard sniper ##s up on bal ##con ##ies like this , and possibly up on the roofs of buildings and anti - aircraft artillery or artillery en ##camp ##ments like that .
what we have presented her is an armored column with air support coming in .
how much jeopardy is a column like this in as it goes through these concrete canyon ##s in a city ?
leon ##hard it ' s a great question .
i think the animation is good because it does show that you can hide literally anywhere in a city environment , and that is why movement through an urban area is very , very dangerous .
it ' s the side that ' s moving that ' s going to take the casualties .
that said , the armored fighting vehicles that you see there they look to me as if they ' re moving a little bit faster as than we probably will .
we ' ll use patience and fines ##se .
we will take the time to locate the enemy , surround the blocks and the buildings that he is in .
and then we ' ll probably surge fires into their both lethal and non ##let ##hal to make his position un ##ten ##able , to make him move rather than us moving through the assault zone .
at which time we can engage them or arrest them .
o ' brien we ' d like to resume with that animation if we could .
that ' s saddam international airport .
that ' s another segment .
can we get back to the animation .
and i ' d like to just finish this out .
here we go .
ad we move it along , you ' ll see eventually the troops will come marching in .
in this case , slightly off target here because you see them all going in the front door .
typically , when they ' d assault a target like this , they ' d do what ?
leon ##hard well , typically , if they do go in , which is generally the option of last resort , but if we do have to go in , often we ' ll try to go in from the top of the building down .
one of the reasons is because we use grenades a lot in clearing buildings , and grenades ten to off ##end downhill rather than up ##hill .
so , you always want them going down staircase ##s rather than having to try to throw them up the staircase .
o ' brien interesting , all right .
gravity rules , even in urban combat .
lieutenant colonel robert leonard , we appreciate your insights in urban combat , something that is not something that the u . s . military would prefer to engage in , but it might become inevitable .
thank you very much for your time .
we appreciate it - - judy .

iraq warns of unconventional counter attack tonight ; saddam sends message suggesting he is alive , still defiant
blitz ##er new explosions rock baghdad after dark .
witnesses say they heard blasts around a presidential complex in the center of the city .
meantime , the u . s . reportedly has hundreds of troops poised to reinforce the baghdad international airport , now under the control of american troops .
a source tells cnn ' s nic robertson , some iraqi republican guard forces are gathering close to the airport .
columns of coalition forces keep pressing north and tightening the no ##ose on baghdad .
cnn ' s central command says some 2 , 500 republican guard forces surrendered , that is , between ku ##t and baghdad .
now , the latest on the fight for control of baghdad ' s international airport .
while coalition forces say they have secured the facility , that ' s not the case in the surrounding area .
it ##n reporter james mates was with the u . s . forces when they moved in to secure the airport .
( begin video ##ta ##pe )
james mates , it ##n correspondent ( voice - over ) it was a show ##piece of his regime .
now saddam international airport is controlled by coalition troops and , tonight , it has a new name , baghdad international .
these pictures were taken on the runway just moments after the coalition attack .
a passenger jet burned out on the tar ##mac .
wreckage burning in a hangar as u . s . troops rush in .
at dawn this morning , u . s . tanks and infantry had rolled in to claim their biggest prize of the war so far .
building by building , they swept the terminal complex , then moved on to secure the runway .
the fall of his airport is a humiliating blow for saddam .
it lies just 12 miles from baghdad and will be a key forward base for u . s . troops as they prepare for a push on the capital .
more than 300 iraqi soldiers have been left dead .
some republican guard troops fought fiercely on the northern side of the airport complex .
unidentified male hopefully , this is a sign that we ' re able to send to the residents of baghdad that we ' re here and they can rise up and deal with the regime appropriately .
mates outside the airport , the fighting was fierce , but the battle une ##qual . here , the remains of an iraqi armored car , and by its side the body of an iraqi soldier , all that remains of a column that pushed up the airport road last night in a final effort to defend the airport .
u . s . troops are now knocking on the door of baghdad .
but the final push into the city could yet prove to be the tough ##est fighting of all .
( on camera ) : the patch ##y , somewhat di ##sor ##gan ##ized defense of the airport last night has left coalition commanders with several questions .
have they done so much damage now to iraqi command and control centers that they can no longer put up a proper fight , or are the best troops simply withdrawing into the city , to fight there street by street ?
the answer to that could well decide how quickly they make a final push into the city .

jane ar ##raf , cnn correspondent ( voice - over ) a few miles further to mo ##sul , kurdish militia and their flags speeding to a town abandoned by iraqi forces .
after a day of fighting , the iraqi ##s were driven back five kilometers , about three miles down the main road west towards mo ##sul from the kurdish city of er ##bil .
soldiers were kurdish , but the special forces calling in air strikes on iraqi positions were american .
as u . s . warp ##lane ##s dropped bombs near the town , kurdish fighters moved forward .
( on camera ) : there ' s a slow - and - steady battle going on here for control of the key bridge .
it ' s a bridge over the river on the main road to mo ##sul .
the iraqi ##s are firing artillery like that in response to the americans are calling in air strikes .
the pe ##sh ##mer ##ga are just down the road , and the iraqi ##s have retreated , but they ' re still holding on to the bridge .

at last report , though , 41 americans had been killed by hostile forces , 13 others by friendly fire or in accidents .
of the 27 british troops , in all who have been killed , at least 19 of them were said to be victims of friendly fire or accidents .
the official iraqi casualty figures remain the same this day , including more than 400 civilians killed , iraqi authorities say .
and u . s . central command says more than 4 , 000 iraqi ##s have been captured , but british officials believe that figure is much higher .

and we will see you then .
well , as coalition forces push ahead in their bid to capture baghdad , big questions remain about saddam hussein and his whereabouts .
it is still not clear , looking at the latest tapes of the iraqi president , whether he ' s dead or alive .
cnn senior international correspondent nic robertson , who was expelled from baghdad , is with us now from the border of iraq and jordan , on the jordanian side , to talk about what ' s happening in the iraqi capital .
nic , we ' re getting information in bits and pieces about the inc ##urs ##ion by coalition land forces , about air flights over the city .
help us pull it all together .
nic robertson , cnn senior international correspondent well , from what we hear from sources in baghdad this evening , it had been mostly quiet in terms of bombing throughout the day in baghdad .
then there was a large explosion not far from the hotel journalists are staying in in the center of baghdad .
along the river ##front there , there are a number of ba ' at ##h party houses and buildings that appear to be - - have some sort of military function .
it ' s not clear exactly what the target was .
what we ' re hearing from iraqi people in the capital today is that they know and they have seen coalition forces in the southwest of the city , in the southeast of the city .
they say they have also seen coalition forces and believe coalition forces have a checkpoint on the northern outskirts of baghdad as well .
so as far as the iraqi people are concerned , they are very aware that coalition forces are right on the perimeter of the city .
our sources are also telling us that iraqi forces are mass ##ing artillery pieces and tanks at a number of locations on the southwestern edge of the city .
these locations , actually , very close to the center of baghdad and appear to be forming something sort of front line against the coalition forces .
now , iraq ' s minister of information today said that the coalition did not have control of the airport , that this was some sort of con ##tri ##ved video from the first day , and that , in fact , hundreds of coalition soldiers had been killed , and their graves were now at the airport .
he did promise to take journalists to the airport , however , he never made - - he did n ' t make good on that promise throughout the day .
the information minister also read a statement from president saddam hussein today , the iraqi leader calling on people to be res ##ol ##ute , to be strong , and saying that if they put up a good fight , then the coalition would eventually back down .

( begin video clip )
roland nu ##gue ##nin - benjamin , international committee of the red cross ( on phone ) we had a chance in the morning to go to the main hospital , which is called ya ##rm ##uk ( ph ) , and we found there has been a steady flow in of hundreds of casualties , all over the night and through into the day , casualties - - i mean , war wounded had to be sent over , dispatched to other hospitals , because this ya ##rm ##uk was just totally overwhelmed by the sheer number of people coming in .
( end video clip )
robertson now , these red cross representatives say that most - - that two - thirds of the casualties they ' ve seen in this particular hospital are , in fact , military casualties .
and iraqi officials promise to take journalists to this particular hospital , the ya ##rm ##uk hospital , that is now located , it ' s on the southwest of baghdad , and it appears to be pretty much between the position of where coalition forces have been seen and where iraq now has a mil ##ita ##rized front - line position .
now , when journalists were taken to see that hospital , twice they were turned around and told that they were n ' t actually allowed to go inside that hospital , judy .
wood ##ruff nic , when you say iraqi ##s are seen now putting artillery pieces out and around the city , are you saying out in the open , where they can - - where they are vulnerable , or are they making any attempt to hide them ?
give us clearer picture of that .
robertson one of the areas where i understand they ' re locating tanks and artillery pieces is the za ##wara ( ph ) park .
this is fairly central in baghdad on the edge of a government area .
it is a garden - - it is a large garden - type area for people to take their children to go and play .
it ' s - - there ' s a small zoo there as well .
it is , if you will , on the - - facing towards the southwestern area of the city .
it faces off against the highway that leads out to the airport .
now , that is not in a residential area .
it is a clear , open area , apart from trees .
the other areas that we understand where iraqi officials are placing tanks and blocking off streets are in more residential areas , judy .
wood ##ruff all right .
nic robertson , giving us a better understanding of exactly what the iraqi ##s are doing to prepare for any further moves by coalition forces .
nic , thank you very much .

saddam hussein and his hen ##ch ##men still claim to control this southern port .

soldiers are here to tear down the regime and all it stands for .

( voice - over ) : drastic action is need to convince a dubious population .
unidentified male get down , get down !
br ##em ##ner we watched a nighttime raid on the homes of ba ' at ##h party officials and fed ##ay ##een militia .
these are men singled out by locals and believed by army intelligence to be behind much of the brutality and corruption .
most are not accused of specific crimes but suspected of being part of the state - sponsored climate of fear .
unidentified male ( un ##int ##elli ##gible ) , get up !
br ##em ##ner the party ' s influence extends to every corner of iraqi society .
in two small communities , we witnessed more than 70 people being rounded up . some are clearly terrified of what lies ahead , uncertain of their fate , overcome by nerves .
but as it ended , there was no british apology for the scale of the operation .
unidentified male we came in firm , we came in fair .
there was no shots fired .
we gave a good warning before we came in .
we ' ve been playing warnings to people to stay in their houses , and we ' ve only lifted those people we ' ve got very good intelligence on .

hello again , miles .
o ' brien hello again , judy .
i ' m joined by j . kelly mccann , our security analyst , a man who ' s spent a lot of time learning about urban combat .
you know , just those two words together , i think , scare a lot of people because of all the things that can go wrong .
you know , i ' m impressed , looking at this map , it almost looks like a chess game , kind of sterile .
that is - - could n ' t be further from the truth , could it ?

we ' re going to kind of play it and stop it , and kelly ' s going to walk us through , i guess , urban combat 101 .
what are we seeing here ?
mccann just there , i mean , just getting the door out of the way , you can see where the weapons have to go .
now , you just see this soldier right here , he ' s going to his side ##arm to make a little bit more mobile .
and he ' s got to be careful of his muzzle pointing at his partner right here .
now , he ' s going to go that direction , because that room is clear .
go ahead and stop the tape .
as you make every entry , miles , there are two dead spots , one , of course , in this direction right here , which you ca n ' t see from the doorway , the other in this direction right here , and that ' s always the problem , because as you come in here , you ' ve got to be able to get in there quickly and make sure that this person here does n ' t get shot in the back .
so . . .

you can see all this area . . .
o ' brien no , just roll it .

just go ahead and roll it .

o ' brien yes , ( un ##int ##elli ##gible ) .
mccann imagine a person that is concealed anywhere in here .
i mean , you could have anyone with a rifle back in these areas here . . .
o ' brien up in this area here , here . . .
mccann . . . in any of these recess ##es back over here .
o ' brien o ##op .
mccann i mean , you know , you ' re looking at - - he would n ' t have a bomb ( un ##int ##elli ##gible ) . . .
o ' brien no , he would n ' t have that .
but let me ask you this .
also that the ga ##rb , ( un ##int ##elli ##gible ) there ' s a cultural issue here .
that provides a lot of cover for weapons if need be , right ?
mccann absolutely .
and someone ##s might say , well , why put their hands on their head like this ?
because , you know , you - - the hands hurt .
and i wo n ' t be able to determine what you ' re doing with your face .
where are your hands and what do they hold ?
o ' brien all right .
let ' s roll it real quickly and we ' ll make a few more points , if we could .
a lot of fear in their faces here .
you see , by the way , they all have radios , i notice they have , like , a little heads ##et there .
that allows them to communicate ( un ##int ##elli ##gible ) . . .
mccann immediate communications , absolutely .
you see them having their sectors of fire .
all these areas up in here , you know , could be subjected to people hiding , et ce ##tera .
now you ' ve got people coming down that have already been cleared .
look at the fear on the faces .
they do n ' t understand what ' s going on .
o ' brien and you want to keep them calm , and . . .
mccann very calm , reassure them that this is n ' t about them .
o ' brien wow .
mccann now , here ' s a little bit more aggressive stance .
exactly .
go ahead and stop tape . . .
o ' brien stop it right there .
oh , we missed it again .
mccann . . . if you can .
obviously , that person is doing something that that soldier did n ' t appreciate .
o ' brien i would say aggressive is a good word for that . . .
mccann absolutely .
o ' brien . . . the business end of that m - 16 .
all right , kelly mccann , thank you for some insights .

you just heard john reporting about it .
they primarily talked about the war in iraq , the aftermath of iraq . but they also discussed the middle east and , as well , getting the northern ireland peace process started up again .
it has been said that saddam hussein ruled iraq with an iron fist .
i guess you can say in the past tense .
his regime has left behind some disturbing evidence to support those claims .

here , prisoners were tortured .

unidentified male you can imagine this every day , every month .

( voice - over ) : but the mu ##kha ##bara ##t headquarters had more horrors to reveal .
unidentified male and they tied their hands behind and hung them and hung them for many days .
nee ##ly these men had relatives murdered here .
so desperate are they to tell their story that they began re ##ena ##cting what they and their brothers and friends have suffered .
the hook in the ceiling is for one purpose only , another hook in a different cell and a different form of torture .
saddam hussein controlled iraq through fear , torture and execution .
and it happened here to tens of thousands of iraqi ##s that saddam ' s secret police deemed dangerous .
this man cow ##ered for months , cr ##ammed with 300 mothers into a huge cell .
hamid fat ##il ( ph ) may look like he ' s acting , but he was tortured here , along with his two brothers , who were executed .
this man was here , too , with his brother .
unidentified male they sentenced him to death .
and they sent him to baghdad and killed .
he was hanged there , hanged .
unidentified male there ' s a prisoner under the name of ahmed adi ##s ae ##id ( ph ) .
nee ##ly they kept records of prisoners , these and their fingerprints all that ' s left of them , apart from the photographs they took of exactly what they had done .
( on camera ) : if there is an evil center to saddam hussein ' s regime , then it is surely here and in other places of torture .
and there ' s plenty here that we simply can not show you .
in this block , it was men over here , hundreds of them , and women and children here . ( voice - over ) : to call all this a chamber of horrors is a cl ##iche .
and this place is beyond cl ##iche .
the hundreds or thousands who died here who were given no trial , no voice , cry out .
on the ground , i found a book called " the psychology of interrogation , " as if the men who worked here for saddam needed a handbook .
i was glad of the fresh air and glad to leave , glad i could .

( begin video ##ta ##pe )
jeff greenfield , cnn sr . analyst ( voice - over ) when an al - ja ##zee ##ra reporter was killed today , the network charged it had been targeted by u . s . force .
central command said , no , its forces were trading fire from a hotel where the network was housed .
at a nearby hotel , two other journalists , a photographer from reuters and another from tel ##e 5 spain died , another case , cent ##com says , of coalition forces returning fire .
a kurdish journalist died in a u . s . friendly - fire accident in the north .
and an american writer / editor , " washington post " editorial columnist michael kelly , was killed when his hum ##ve ##e plunged into a canal while eva ##ding iraqi fire .
( on camera ) : it is an elementary fact of life during wartime : a press pass provides no protection . ( voice - over ) : famed world war ii reporter ernie p ##yle was killed by a sniper on an island in the pacific .
famed combat photographer robert cap ##a , who took a classic photo of a fighter ' s death during the spanish civil war , himself died from a land mine in indochina .
sean flynn , son of the famous actor er ##rol flynn , disappeared in cambodia in 1970 .
more than 65 journalists of many nationalities died in southeast asia .
abc news producer david kaplan was killed by sniper fire in the balkans in 1992 . sometimes reporters , like " the wall street journal " ' s danny pearl , die in covering a different kind of war .
pearl was murdered by terrorists in pakistan .
the casualty count helps put the ongoing debate about journalist ##ic neutrality into a sharpe ##r light .
the 600 journalists embedded with american troops in iraq will be threatened by the same fire as the troops they are covering .
their safety , their lives , may depend on those troops .
neutrality in a fire ##fight ?
not likely .
and that raises a bigger question .
are they supposed to be neutral on the outcome of the war ?
in an interview with broadcasting and cable magazine , cbs news president andrew hey ##ward said of the neutrality notion - - quote - - " it ' s one of the stupid ##est things i ' ve ever heard .
this story is going to be told from a u . s . point of view .
we are american reporters , the ones with the troops . " ( on camera ) : now , none of this means journalists will ignore un ##sett ##ling news : military set ##backs , lack of supplies , the in ##flict ##ion of civilian casualties .
reporters who ignore or di ##stor ##t facts are betray ##ing their craft no matter what and no matter how much that may anger the people running a war .
but whether in the old soviet union or nazi germany or south africa or iraq , respect for the facts does not require a reporter to throw his values over the side .

christine cup ##olo , teacher yes , i do .
my brother is in kuwait .
roberts my sister is a grammar school teacher in clayton , north carolina .
cup ##olo he was sent over right next to the persian gulf now since new year ' s eve . and this is one of many deployment ##s he ' s been on , but this one is probably the most crucial .
roberts her second - graders were very interested in sending some letters out to the troops .
cup ##olo so , i knew that , at one point or another , my children needed to write .
i thought that would be a real up ##lifting experience for the troops .
roberts and she says : " dear brave friend .
hello .
my name is amanda . "
unidentified female " we would have to say that you are a very brave person .
when the war starts , your heart will be in our souls . "
roberts for these kids to takes time to read letters to us and stuff like that in their class , what more can you ask ?
just keep it going .
ka ##gan there will be more letters on the way .
back in north carolina , the river ##wood elementary second - graders are working on the next batch .
cup ##olo absolutely .
you might want to mention that in your letter as well .
ka ##gan this time , they hope the sailors will write back with answers to their questions .
cup ##olo so you want to know how fast the dolphins there are swimming ?
ok .
i would write that down .
i would say : " dear , friend , i have some questions for you .
i want to know about the dolphins that are helping you out over there . " can you do that ?
do you think you could ask them a question ? sure .
they will be happy to answer it .
we started work on our letters the last week of february and worked on them the first week of march and sent them out a few weeks ago .
and they got the letters pretty quickly over there .
but i think this helps me stay closer to my brother .
ka ##gan ( on camera ) any message to your sister ?
roberts yes .
i ' d just like to tell her , thank you very much , christine .
hope you ' re doing well in north carolina .
and thank you very much to your students for all the support and the letters that they sent out to us .

saddam hussein is losing grip on northern cities in iraq
( news break )
wood ##ruff yesterday , there were scenes of ju ##bil ##ation in baghdad , today , a suicide bombing and firefighters , grim reminder ##s that , as u . s . central command put it , baghdad is still an ugly place .
cnn ' s john irvine has this profile of a city literally tee ##tering on a razor ' s edge .
( begin video ##ta ##pe )
john irvine , cnn correspondent ( voice - over ) getting acquainted , very deliberately , the u . s . marines are trying to strike up a rap ##port with the people who are now their responsibility .
but there are still problems bringing control to baghdad , particularly at nighttime .
in the pitch black of a city without power , these soldiers manning a road ##block became nervous .
unidentified male stay the ( ex ##ple ##tive deleted ) back !
back up !
irvine when a car fails to stop , it ' s the cue for a violent gun battle .
bullets are sprayed everywhere .
in parts of baghdad that the americans have n ' t yet reached , there has been looting .
this man took the horse from a stable at the home of ud ##ay hussein , saddam ' s eldest son .
we found the house , a large , ga ##udy structure , a place that just a few days ago people did n ' t even look at for fear of their lives .
this indeed was one of ud ##ay ' s homes .
here , the ruling family could look out over the ti ##gr ##is . people have wasted no time clearing the house and wreck ##ing what could n ' t be easily taken .
( on camera ) : they have n ' t quite worked out just how to reach this will chan ##del ##ier yet .
but , other than that , they have stripped this place bare in less than 24 hours .
call it pl ##under , if you will , or perhaps pay ##back .
( voice - over ) : these iraqi ##s were ri ##fl ##ing a home of a senior member of the mu ##kha ##bara ##t , saddam ' s dread ##ed secret police .
it also seemed to be some kind of monitoring station .
there was sophisticated equipment here .
in the basement , we found burning archives and evidence of electronic surveillance .
this had been a nerve center for spying , a place from where the bully boys kept tab ##s to keep control .
( on camera ) : we ' re now in the bow ##els of a secret police monitoring station .
look at all this ga ##dget ##ry , quite sinister really , part of the apparatus of big brother .

saddam hussein is losing grip on northern cities in iraq
wood ##ruff some pictures .
well , lai ##th ku ##bba is an iraqi exile who has family members in iraq .
mr . ku ##bba is a senior fellow at a think tank called the national endowment for democracy .
he is also the president of a group of iraqi exiles , a group called the iraq national group .
he joins us now from london to talk about rebuilding his country .
mr . ku ##bba , first of all , your thoughts as you ' ve watched these scenes of baghdad , the saddam hussein regime falling in the last day ?
lai ##th ku ##bba , president , iraqi national group it is a huge sigh of relief , because it could have been much worse and baghdad could have been a war theater with more destruction to property . and , obviously , there are four million people who could have suffered more .
so , there is a sigh of relief that it is not worse .
but , obviously , there is a great , great concern about the scenes that you ' ve been showing on television .
wood ##ruff are you talking to family members now in baghdad and around iraq ?
and , if you are , how concerned are they about the law ##lessness ?
ku ##bba well , not in the recent three or four days .
there are no phone lines to baghdad .
in other parts of iraq , i received with great sadness the killing of one close colleague , sa ##eed abu na ##ji ab ##hue ##y ( ph ) in na ##ja ##f .
he was not killed by former members of the ba ##ath party or the security of the army , but by just a local organized group .
so those signs to me are worrying .
people are sensing and feeling the lack of authority or the power vacuum and are testing it .
and the more they test , the more i think they are claiming .
wood ##ruff how difficult will it be to sort out who will next hold power in iraq after this transition period , however long it is , where the u . s . is in charge ?
ku ##bba well , one needs to break down this process into various elements .
today , there should be an authority .
and it ' s very likely that the u . s . and the british forces are the authority on land .
and there ought to be administration .
and this ought to be primarily by iraqi ##s .
but when it comes to government , i think we really need to map out step by step how to move from this power vacuum to the day we have elections .
we need to involve the u . n . we need to involve all iraqi forces in the country , outside the country .
but we need to do it quickly , because every day passes by with this vacuum , it ' s going to spell trouble .
wood ##ruff well , we know , mr . ku ##bba , there are several iraqi exiles groups competing for influence .
is one of them going to have an advantage ?
and , particularly , i have in mind the iraqi national congress that mr . cha ##lab ##i , who was assisted by u . s . forces in getting back into iraq ?
ku ##bba i think it ' s one thing to gain fame and access to washington .
it ' s totally another to gain legitimacy and functioning grounds inside iraq . and i think plans must not be drawn in thin air out in washington .
it must really be drawn on the ground inside iraq .
and there are 22 million people there .
it ' s not a void .
it ' s not a vacuum .
and i think all plans must be anchored there in iraq in its reality .
wood ##ruff so does one group have an advantage over another now ?
ku ##bba there are different groups who have advantage over others in different parts of the country .
unfortunately , we do not have a national group that can appeal to iraqi ##s as iraqi ##s within a credible voice .
this needs to be constructed , maybe through a conference to be held in baghdad , where representatives from provinces all over iraq need to participate , as well as political groups .
but we do not have a single group , a single leadership or a single council yet .
wood ##ruff we ' re talking with lai ##th ku ##bba , who is the president of a group of iraqi exiles .
the group is called the iraq national group .
mr . ku ##bba , we thank you so much for talking to us from london .
ku ##bba thank you .
wood ##ruff we appreciate it .
ku ##bba thank you .
wood ##ruff here in washington , members of the house of representatives come together to support america ' s armed forces .

well , after many trying months of defending saddam hussein , ambassador mohammed aldo ##uri finally said the game is over .
now , his tenure at the united nations is over , too .
last night before leaving the united states , aldo ##uri said he hopes to see free elections in a free iraq .
cnn ' s richard roth has more on this once prominent frontman for the iraqi regime .
( begin video ##ta ##pe )
richard roth , cnn senior u . n . correspondent ( voice - over ) the last time iraqi ' s u . n . ambassador addressed the security council , the u . s . ambassador walked out in protest .
mohammed aldo ##uri , iraqi ambassador to u . n . ( through translator ) what happened is that the iraqi army up until now has not confronted the united states forces .
roth but now , it ' s the iraqi ambassador ' s time to leave , the united states .
aldo ##uri the game is over .
i hope that peace will pre ##va ##il , and that the iraqi people at the end of the day will have a peaceful life .
roth mohammed aldo ##uri spent more years as a university professor than as a diplomat .
in new york , he brief ##ed people interested in his country , recently a group of lehigh university students .
but he never got comfortable in the media glare before and especially during the war .
unidentified male you said you were n ' t . . .
aldo ##uri ( un ##int ##elli ##gible ) has happened with you ?
please , why did you come here ?
unidentified male because we thought . . .
aldo ##uri tomorrow , i will see you in the u . n .
roth and at the u . n . , all ambassadors carry out their instructions whether they agree with them or not .
juan gabriel val ##des , chilean ambassador to u . s . well , i think that he had a very , very difficult task .
he defended the positions of his country with courage , i would say .
jeremy greens ##tock , british ambassador to u . n . he ' s a decent man , and i hope he finds a decent life representing a decent government .
unidentified male aldo ##uri is a dear friend of mine .
roth aldo ##uri also drew support from opponents of the war a gift of paper cranes .
but on the eve of aldo ##uri ' s departure , women representing the daughters of the american revolution passed by , wanting to let fly with something else .
unidentified female if i had eggs , i would like to throw eggs at him .
roth u . n . diplomats do n ' t toss eggs , just nods .
several months ago , the u . s . ambassador , john negro ##pon ##te , and the iraqi ambassador almost locked eyes . and forget about kuwait .
mohammed abu ##l ##has ##an , kuwait ##i ambassador to u . n . nothing .
unidentified male not one word ?
abu ##l ##has ##an not one word , except a normal greeting of , " hello , how are you ? "
roth that was as close as residents of new york ' s upper east side district got to know aldo ##uri , who kept a low profile , like many in the big city .
it ' s a neighborhood you would n ' t expect the diplomatic post of an enemy government to turn up .
aldo ##uri i am very thankful for the people of new york , for their generosity .
this is a very decent people .
i was really - - without talking about the problem in iraq , i was really happy to be here in new york , within the people of new york .
roth aldo ##uri was worried most about the people of iraq .
aldo ##uri when i see , what i ' ve seen , what you see , my heart squeeze ##s blood .
roth aldo ##uri was in better spirits as he departed for the airport with a final message .
aldo ##uri i hope that the united states army will leave iraq soon , and we will have free election for a free government for a free future for iraq and the people for iraq .
this is my message to you , to the people of the united states .
roth the ambassador ' s prime concern now : his family in iraq .
one day he hopes to teach again back home .

the work of the devil doc ##s is by no means over .
the navy has set up a helicopter landing zone just a 100 meters from a mobile operating room , just on the outskirts of baghdad .
this is the closest front line surgical company .
corps ##men quickly take patients by ambulance away from the blowing sand to a tri ##age tent .
it is there the doctors begin their work .
over 45 minutes as we watched , 32 patients were delivered here , evaluated and nine operations started ; 29 of those delivered , marines involved in a fire ##fight in the center of baghdad . their stories could be seen in the sh ##ra ##p ##nel wounds of rocket - propelled grenades and bullet wounds from semi - automatic weapons .
the operations are on their hands , abdomen and face .
two of the marines , too far gone . for many of the survivors , that news is the most difficult to handle . along with the medical care , hands are held , spirits are lifted .

blitz ##er welcome back to late edition .
we return now to my interview earlier today with the united states defense secretary , donald rum ##sf ##eld .
( begin video ##ta ##pe )
blitz ##er i know during the war , before the war , you were very concerned about the position of the syrian government , cooper ##ating with iraqi ##s , having an open border , if you will .
has the situation improved , especially in the aftermath now of the secretary of state ' s meeting with basha ##r al - asa ##d ?
rum ##sf ##eld well , i guess time will tell .
i talked to secretary powell this morning on the phone a bit , and it ' s not , i think you need to let the dust settle on that .
he ' s , in my judgment , had a visit that was worth doing , and the president asked him to do it , and it was the right thing to do .
we ' ll see what progress comes .
you know , words are one thing , actions are another .
blitz ##er but right now you ' re open - minded as far as syria on whether they will crack down on terrorism , take some of the other steps that you want them to take ?
rum ##sf ##eld i know what they ' ve been doing , and it ' s been un ##hel ##pf ##ul .
i know that secretary powell was just there and advised them that it was un ##hel ##pf ##ul , and gave them some pointer ##s and some suggestions for the future .
in my view , they were making some un ##wise decisions previously .
what they ' ll do after this visit remains to be seen .
blitz ##er the secretary of state has written you a letter expressing , apparently , some concern about the length that the prisoners are going to be spending , those detained at the u . s . naval base at guantanamo bay in cuba , about 600 or so of them .
is there any movement in trying to determine the fate of these individuals ?
rum ##sf ##eld i do n ' t think that ' s quite accurate as to what he wrote me about .
blitz ##er all right , tell me what . . .
rum ##sf ##eld i think what he wrote me about was the fact that the inter - agency process , where we have all these fbi and department of justice and cia and dia , and what have you , involved in inter ##ro ##gating these detainees , it takes time to find out what intelligence they have .
it also takes time to figure out what law enforcement process might be appropriate , and what colin and i have been concerned about , both of us , is that it ' s taking so long .
there are a number of countries , and the department of state has the responsibility of dealing with those countries , that have foreign nationals in gi ##tm ##o , in guantanamo bay , cuba , being detained , and those countries , understand ##ably , would like to know when they could have those people .
so the inter - agency process takes a great deal of time .
colin and i are trying to speed up that process , and that ' s what that ' s all about .
blitz ##er let me just , a couple of nu ##gg ##ets to sort of wrap up before i let you go . victory parades for the troops .
i remember covering general schwarz ##ko ##pf , the parades in washington and new york after the first gulf war .
do you want the troops to be honored in that way when they come back , to have parades in new york , washington , elsewhere ?
rum ##sf ##eld there ' s no question but that the troops , the young men and women , did such a superb job that there has to be a way to honor them , and there will be .
and general franks and his team have done just a superb job for our country and for the world , and indeed for the iraqi people , who have been liberated .
what ' s the best way to do that ?
in the case of 1991 , the task was to go in and get them out of kuwait , and they did it , and they were properly greeted coming back to the united states .
in this instance , it was a very different task .
it was to remove that regime , and it ' s part of a global war on terrorism that is not over .
we still have to face the problem of a number of global terrorist networks and terrorist states that exist , that work with those global networks .
and on the one hand we will , in fact , find a way to honor the courage and dedication and talent of these young men and women , and we ' ll do it well .
whether it will be modeled off the 1991 thing , i do n ' t know .
i kind of doubt it , because it ' s such a different circumstance .
certainly , our war plan was not modeled off of 1991 .
blitz ##er one final question on north korea .
if the north koreans pursue their nuclear weapons ambitions . . .
rum ##sf ##eld yes .
blitz ##er . . . a pre ##em ##ptive strike , is that something that is out there ?
rum ##sf ##eld i ' m not one who spec ##ulates about things like that .
i know that back in the 1990s , in the clinton administration , secretary perry called in the former secretaries of defense , and we had a discussion , and they clearly had tee ##d up a military option that they were considering , and they then at a certain moment were able to do some things that persuaded them that that was not appropriate .
but those are very serious issues , and i leave them for the president .

blitz ##er president bush aboard the uss abraham lincoln on thursday , formally declaring the successful accomplishment of the military mission in iraq . welcome back to late edition .
joining us now are two key members of the united states senate foreign relations committee .
in his home state of indiana , the committee ' s chairman , republican senator richard lu ##gar .
and here in washington , democratic senator christopher dodd of connecticut . senators , welcome back to late edition .
mr . chairman , let me begin with you .
are you among those who are beginning to conclude that , when all the dust settles , the u . s . may not find weapons of mass destruction in iraq ?
sen . richard lu ##gar ( r ) , indiana no , i con ##cu ##r with secretary powell , secretary rum ##sf ##eld , the president , that weapons of mass destruction are there , and likewise , that we will be led to them by people knowledge ##able in the country as to where they are . what form we may find them and what traces of destruction and all the rest of it will be very interesting and , likewise , the intellectual capital that is there to produce more .
because not much else is - - you do n ' t need much to get it going again .
and that , i think , we have to be working with these people who are in the business to make sure they do n ' t re - enter the business , much as we did with russian scientists under the nun ##n - lu ##gar program .
blitz ##er what about you , senator dodd , do you believe , in the end , they will find weapons of mass destruction ?
sen . christopher dodd ( d ) , connecticut i have no evidence to the contrary .
and certainly , they have used them in the past .
there ' s no doubt about that at all , both in iran and against the kurdish population .
so , whether or not they find them in the exact form that many would assume they would be the case - - possibly some got out of the country .
it would n ' t surprise me to hear that .
but i ' m going to work on the assumption , based on the intelligence that has been gathered , that the weapons of mass destruction existed .
blitz ##er what if they do n ' t ?
dodd well , you know , they ' ve used it in the past , and i think the point that senator lu ##gar just made - - certainly having the intellectual capacity to do this was proven already by the fact they ' ve used them in the past .
so , i would n ' t dwell on that point specifically , because saddam hussein clearly was a producer and a user of biological and chemical weapons .
he clearly was on the track to acquire a nuclear capacity , and the world is a safer place today because he ' s not ruling iraq .
blitz ##er will the u . s . lose credit ##ability , mr . chairman , if , if the u . s . finds no hard evidence , no so - called smoking gun ?
lu ##gar no , we have full credibility in iraq .
we ' ve prosecuted with the alliance a successful liberation of the iraqi people , and we have clearly caused saddam to destroy weapons of mass destruction , or at least to suppress evidence of them .
that is a victory of sorts .
this is a face ##t that ' s important .
it ' s important in the war against terrorism that we ro ##ut out whatever is there and , likewise , the people involved , because they might help supply al qaeda or other terrorists along the trail .
blitz ##er senator dodd , how important is it for the u . s . to con ##clusive ##ly learn what happened to saddam hussein ?
dodd well , it ' s important .
but i do n ' t think it ' s as important as finding os ##ama bin laden , for the simple reason that i do n ' t think saddam hussein today poses any threat , wherever he is .
if he is alive , obviously , he does n ' t pose the kind of threat that an os ##ama bin laden does with his cellular network around the world to react ##ivate al qaeda and international terrorism .
so , it would certainly be good to know where he is .
it would be , certainly , to know , to app ##re ##hend him , to bring him before a court of justice .
but i do n ' t think it ' s absolutely critical for the ultimate success of this mission that we app ##re ##hend him or find out what happened to him .
blitz ##er and you agree with that assessment , mr . chairman ?
lu ##gar yes , i think that senator dodd is right on .

interview with donald rum ##sf ##eld ; lu ##gar , dodd talk about post - war iraq ; kissing ##er , cohen discuss middle east road map
blitz ##er what about the length of the u . s . military presence in iraq , senator lu ##gar ?
how long do you anti ##ci ##pate large numbers of u . s . troops will remain there ?
lu ##gar well , i was heart ##ened by what secretary rum ##sf ##eld told you in the last interview , that we will have troops there as long as necessary , but no longer than necessary .
i think that ' s a pretty good way to state it .
my own view is that the security of the country clearly is our responsibility presently .
we are trying to pass that on to others . likewise , the other government ' s procedures , the fledgling beginnings on democracy , and all the rest .
but that ' s going to require an under ##gi ##rdi ##ng . now , in due course , as everybody points out , we may get help from other countries .
we may bring in nato allies or the united nations or other people in the arab world .
that would be helpful .
but for the moment , this is our responsibility .
and we ought not to be having large debates about how rapidly we move out .
and i was upset , in a way , to hear reports that by the fall , three divisions out of five would be gone .
i think secretary rum ##sf ##eld di ##sa ##bus ##ed us of that today .
blitz ##er and what about you , senator dodd , not only the length of time , but the cost to u . s . taxpayers ?
have you been given any ball ##park estimate what this is going to cost the united states ?
dodd no .
well , what we ' ve heard the numbers of reconstruction running around $ 100 billion .
we put $ 2 . 5 billion in , in the last supplemental appropriations bill .
so it ' s going to be costly .
these rf ##ps , these seeking bids on various contracts are rather costly , and so it ' s going to be expensive .
and clearly the responsibility is going to fall principally on the united states .
now , i would hope that sooner rather than later we could see a civilian government emerge in iraq , a democratic ##ally elected one , that there ' d be more cooperation from the international community , on both the peacekeeping side as well as the political restructuring that ' s necessary in iraq .
and to the extent we can move that along more quickly , i think we ' re all going to be better off .
being the sole , or almost the sole power there , both in terms of reconstruction and politically , expose ##s us to great vu ##ln ##era ##bilities .
blitz ##er senator lu ##gar , we have to take a quick break , but before we do , i wanted to just ask you , the u . n . role - - you say there could be a u . n . role .
do you specifically want the united nations to have some sort of peacekeeping role there ?
and second ##ari ##ly , what about countries like france , germany , and russia , which opposed the bush administration ' s war plans , do you want them shut out ?
lu ##gar no , i do n ' t want anybody shut out .
and i do hope the united nations will play a vital role in iraq , whether it be in peacekeeping or various other ways , and i hope that that will occur soon .
i think we really need an international ##ization of the process , for the very reasons that senator dodd pointed out .
blitz ##er all right .
we ' re going to take that quick break .
stand by , senators .
we have a lot more ground to cover .
senators lu ##gar and dodd will be staying with us .
they ' ll also be taking your phone calls .

" time " magazine ' s michael weiss ##ko ##pf has uncovered some stunning details about the lives of these two .
he joins us now from washington .
thanks for taking the time to join us .
michael , as i read the article , we knew that these were not good guys , putting it mildly , but as you saw and heard the revelations , what were your reactions ?
they ' re stomach turning , to put it blunt ##ly .
the extent of the de ##pr ##avi ##ty was truly ##0s ##tu ##nni ##ng , you ' re right and they took different paths , these two guys .
the younger of the two brothers , qu ##say was a very ic professional killer who pulled the trigger with political aim in mind .
we have eye ##wi ##tness ##es to his orders of execution of hundreds of people in 1991 during the shi ##ite muslim uprising .
his brother , ud ##ay , was very highly personal , arbitrary , spontaneous in his attacks , extended to young girls , to friends , to employees .
it was just extraordinary .
with ud ##ay , i mean , the stories , you open the article , what you cow ##rot ##e this article the sum of two evil ##s , the reign of terror with saddam ' s sons abd ##uc ##ting a 14 - year - old , rap ##ing her , crashing wedding parties to rape the bride ##s .
was that about as bad as it got with these guys ?
i guess it ca n ' t get much worse .
i thought that the depth may be how he treated his friends , % and there are a couple of stories we heard about how he forced friends to drink large quantities of grain alcohol until they vomit ##ed .
also one friend he was afraid was going to leave the country and spill the beans on him .
he had him arrested by his fed ##ay ##een saddam .
he had him held down , tong pulled out by pl ##iers and sliced off with a sc ##ape ##l .
awful .
people still fear them and saddam hussein himself . how did you get people to talk ?
were they forthcoming or pretty re ##tic ##ent about talking about these guys ?
it was a hard report .
it was hard to find people , and then hard to get them to talk .
over time , we gained trust .
we promised to hold on to people ' s an ##oni ##mity if we could . after a little while , after we prime ##d the pump , the people wanted to

how could so many people end up in prison for crimes they did n ' t commit ?
the story behind the defendants of tu ##lia , texas , is our " headlines timeline . " july 23rd , 1999 - - there was a massive drug bust in a pre ##dom ##inate ##ly african - american neighborhood in tu ##lia .
of the 46 people arrested , 39 are african - american .
the case against them was based on the testimony of undercover officer thomas coleman .
coleman claimed he bought drugs from the defendants , but offered little or no supporting evidence . after the first of several trials ended with convictions and harsh sentences , most of the other defendants pleaded guilty to avoid hard time .
march 17 , 2003 - - with coleman ' s credibility under serious attack , new hearings for the tu ##lia defendants get under way .
the hearings are stopped when the judge , defense attorneys and prosecutors agree that coleman lied under oath and is a racist .
coleman denies doing anything wrong .
it took a special act of the texas legislature to clear the way for monday ' s release . but these men and the others caught up in the tu ##lia tragedy are still convicted criminals .
now it ' s up to the appeals court and the board of pardon and parole ##s to officially clear their names .

it looks like an annual tradition is building .
80 , 000 people with a shared love of music converge on a tennessee pasture for three days of good vibe ##s and who knows what else .
it ' s called bonn ##aro ##o .
check it out .
bonn ##aro ##o is kind of this going example of what the whole jam band community is turned in .
that ' s what i really like about the jam community .
it ' s acceptance of imp ##rov ##ization ##al music , d ##pes pit whatever region or gen re .
it ' s about the freedom of the music and the freedom of expression .
well , we sold all 80 , 000 tickets through our web site .
we sold out in 16 days .
i mean , the amazing thing is , we used no traditional advertising .
we put all these bands together .
it draws a huge audience . so the record companies and the music business has to take all of these forms of music more seriously .
it ' s like strength in numbers .
i hope this kind of thing can happen in america , instead of it just being these isolated festivals like bonn ##aro ##o , it really can happen in 100 cities every summer , like the festivals do in europe .
my only complaint is the overlapping .
you know , as a music lover that i am , there ' s five acts all playing at the same time on five different stages that i want to see .
it really comes from the actual bands and the fact that there ' s this grassroots following that ' s been there , you know , for a long time .
primarily started by the grateful dead , at least the future by the grateful dead .
we will get ##0 by we will survive
we ' re carrying on a tradition that started a long time .
in american music , imp ##rov ##ization is what it ' s always been ar ##ped .
it ' s not just clapping and having a good time .
it makes you feel a certain kind of love , and hopefully , that translates in the community .
you go out , you hug someone .
you do something good .

good morning .
a crazy world we live in .
the supreme court of the united states upheld the tough ##est three strikes law in the country yesterday .
that ' s california ' s .
they rejected challenges to the law of sentences of 25 years to life without parole for a man convicted of stealing some golf clubs and 50 years for a man who stole some video ##ta ##pes .
the idea is if you have three felony convictions , you ' re out of here .
the voters overwhelmingly passed the law in 1994 to offset the liberal and len ##ient judges to let bad people off with nothing more than a slap of the wrist .
they appealed to the supreme court on behalf of these two people .
currently in california , 700 ##0 people serving 25 to year life sentences under the three strikes law .
one - third of them - - not that .
300 of them are in there for things like petty theft .
25 other states that have the three strikes law .

she looks very , very healthy .

and could n ' t believe , i think , as a 4 - year - old now that his sister is home .
with the darkness that surrounds us in these times of the possibility of war that could be coming upon us and a miracle that has been brought to us , an incredible miracle that has been brought to our family , words can not express how grateful we are for the prayers around the world .
do miracles still exist ?

we were lacking at the front page of the jerusalem post the other day .
the big banner headline that day big and bold , was president bush issues ultimatum .
on the side column , as an after ##th ##ough ##t , sit tense told to carry gas masks wherever they go .
it gives you a sense of , perhaps what 50 years of tension and war will do to your mental ##ity .
but it does also say that the israelis are a bit more b ##lase , if that ' s a fair word for it , than perhaps we are . president bush , when he talked earlier to reporters , mentioned that this effort is an effort , this war is an effort to make the homeland , our homeland , more secure .
john king , that whole issue of homeland security must be so much on the minds of so many government officials , given the level of the terror alert today .
reporter : so far , so good is the assessment we ' re getting from senior administration officials as they try to track what they worry about most .
as we have the strikes overseas throughout iraq , there will be re ##tal ##ia ##tory terror strikes , either by organized terrorist networks or sympathetic terrorists or people against the united states in this country .
so far , so good .
no plans , we ' re told , to raise the threat level , though it ' s already at orange , which is high .
so microsoft of the president ' s business has been behind the scenes today .
he ' s the most senior of about a handful of senior administration officials , including the vice president and the secretary of state .

the president offered a brief statement in the cabinet room .
call my cabinet together to review our strategies , to make the world more peaceful , to make our country more secure .
to make the lives of our citizens as healthy and as prosperous as possible .
we heard from secretary rum ##sf ##eld who brief ##ed us on the early stages of the war . there is no question we ' ve set the finest of our citizens into harm ' s way .
they performed with great skill and great bravery .

reporter : so even at the very early stages of a defining moment of bush presidency , the president trying to make the case his eyes and especially the eyes of his cabinet still on the domestic affairs of the united states as the early prosecution of the war continues .
one thing the president said that will be the point of contention around the world , the president called it an ever - growing coalition of 40 countries .
that is handful more nations that were actively involved in the coalition his father assembled 12 years ago for the persian gulf war , but there is a significant difference , of course .
in this coalition , it ip ##s the united states doing the overwhelming load of the fighting .
british forces on the ground , australian troops scheduled to take part , perhaps in some way .
in the last gulf war , you had arab forces on the ground .
the egyptians , syrian ##s , saudi ##s , qatar ##is taking up arms to ex ##pel the iraqi arm ##iy kuwait .
no such participation this time around .

we are watching activity in baghdad .
while we do , we want to tell you marines battling for control of the bridges in the southern city of nas ##iri ##yah face stiff resistance from iraqi paramilitary groups today . for some perspective , let ' s turn to miles o ' brien with retired air force general don she ##pper ##d .
thank you very much .
if you are going to fight on the ground , you have to encounter bridges somewhere along the way .
a lot of bridges between where the 3 7 cavalry and the rest of the u . s . forces are now and their ultimate destination , downtown baghdad .
we have the city laid out for you here .
how many bridges in this city alone ?
in this map we have right here , 13 major bridges in downtown baghdad , including the expressway bridge over here .
three bridges here attach ##ing east baghdad to west baghdad and the palace area .
this is one technique , one possible way u . s . forces might seize a bridge , a bridge that might be defended by iraqi ##s .
let ' s look at the animation .
typical scenario there .
it does n ' t really matter for this scenario that we ' re laying out here .
this would be representing m1 - a1 tanks coming towards the bridge firing .
you have to bundle up and line up to go across that bridge .
makes it vulnerable to fire from the other side .
potentially chemical weapons , too .
as we turn the other direction , what you ' ll see are these iraqi tanks that are kind of fortified there .
they have burns in front of them . artillery behind them firing back .
and then they there goes the smoke screen .
the idea of the smoke screen is to obscure the on ##coming forces fire ing at you from being able to see .
it does n ' t work , though .
it works both ways .
it obscure ##s you but also obscure ##s them .

on we go in the meantime .
again , today , there were disturbing hints , and we under ##sco ##re hints here , that coalition forces may soon face an attack using chemical weapons .
yesterday the story centered on intelligence regarding enemy intentions .
today the evidence is somewhat more tangible .
reporting for us , cnn ' s david en ##sor .
reporter : the evidence is acc ##um ##ulating that iraq may be planning to use chemical weapons .
gas masks turning up in abandoned trenches .
in nas ##iri ##yah in a building marked as a hospital u . s . marines found weapons , at ##rop ##ine anti ##dote kits , and that was not all .
they found over 3 , 000 chemical suits and gas masks as well as a number of iraqi military uniforms .
reporter : the findings are height ##ening concerns among coalition forces approaching baghdad since , as the iraqi ##s should know , u . s . and british forces do not use chemical weapons .
u . s . officials say some intelligence indicates a red line may have been drawn around the capital with republican guard units ordered to use chemical weapons once u . s . and allied troops cross it .
there is also intelligence , officials say , suggesting republican guard units have been issued artillery shells containing chemical agents .
there has been intelligence scrap ##s , who knows how accurate they are , chatter in the system , that suggests that the closer that coalition forces get to baghdad and ti ##kr ##it the greater the likelihood and that some command and control arrangements have been put in place .
reporter : in baghdad deputy prime minister tar ##iq aziz repeated his government ' s stand - - it does not have any kind of weapons of mass destruction .
translator : when they started to talk about the weapons of mass destruction , we know and we always knew that that was fabrication and lines .
reporter : experts say saddam hussein ' s forces will likely try to hold out in baghdad for as long as possible without using the weapons his government insists it does not have , hoping to build international pressure on the u . s . and britain to back down .
in that sense any use of chemical weapons would be counter ##pro ##ductive to saddam , because it would only gal ##vani ##ze international

we ' re getting late word tonight that gerald ##o rivera may not be be kicked out of iraq after all .
originally the central command said the veteran fox news correspond was being expelled because he compromised the location of the unit he ' s been embedded with .
now a spokesman from the central command is saying and i ' m quoting " frankly , we have bigger and more important things to do . " during a live broadcast gerald ##o drew a map in the sand showing the location of the unit in relation to baghdad .
says he ' s not aware he ' s being expelled but says if so , it is because some bitter former colleagues of his at ms ##nbc blew the whistle on him .
it sounds to me like some rats at my former network , nbc , are spreading some lies about me .
you know , they ca n ' t compete fair and square on the battlefield so they ' re trying to stab me in the back .
it is not first time .
the central command on the other hand says rivera is being kicked out of iraq because " he gave away the big picture stuff .
" all of this now under review , whether or not gerald ##o stays or goes .
we ' ll continue to monitor that front on the store yi ##x another veteran war correspondent is being fired for his controversial conduct in iraq .
nbc is terminating freelance ##r reporter peter ar ##nett for statements he made to the iraqi media .
we showed you the statements yesterday .
he said the coalition ' s first war plan had failed because of iraqi resistance .
today he appeared on on nbc ' s " today " show and said he was sorry .
i want to apologize to the american people for clearly making a mis ##ju ##d ##gm ##ent over the weekend by giving an interview to iraqi television .
now , i said in that interview essentially what we all know about the war , there have been delays in implementing policy , there has been surprises .
but clearly by giving that interview to iraqi television , i created a fires ##torm in the united states .
and for that i am truly sorry .
ar ##nett had been covering the war for national geographic , which also fired him as tv reports were given exclusively to nbc and ms ##nbc .
late word from london that the tabloid the daily mirror just hired peter ar ##nett to be its correspondent in baghdad .
but the question remains did peter ar ##nett and gerald ##o rivera cross the line ? or were they within their rights as reporters ?
we posed that question to michael wolf , a contributing editor for " new york " magazine , a media columnist , an important article in the new issue of " new york .

bombardment of baghdad continues tonight and over the past 20 minutes , explosions rocking baghdad , central baghdad southern baghdad , the outskirts of baghdad , and importantly , as the coalition forces , principally u . s . army forces , move against saddam hussein international airport - - which is about ten miles outside the center of baghdad - - those explosions are int ##ens ##ifies .
if we may again going to the wide screen of what appears to me to be abu dhabi television that is providing this picture , 3 : 20 a . m . in baghdad , live pictures again .
that it is very difficult to disc ##ern whether or not that is , in point of fact , the missiles that we have become accustomed to striking baghdad and its en ##vir ##ons , or whether it is the large 2 , 000 pound jd ##am bombs that have been striking targets sc ##le ##cted by the coalition in baghdad , or whether these flashes now represent artillery barrage ##s as fighting continues to take control of the - - to take control of saddam international airport .
again , correspondent ##s , our correspondent ##s with the - - embedded with these forces , with them in the field , saying in some cases they can see the lights of the skyline of baghdad .
over the course of the past two weeks , since this war began , something like 23 , 000 coalition sort ##ies have been flown , and over the course of the past 24 hours , 1 , 900 sort ##ies flown .
and we are told that , of those , 850 were strike sort ##ies , motor vehicle most of those directed against the republican guard .
as you know , the republican guard just outside baghdad to defend the city and saddam hussein ' s regime , in principal .
two of those divisions absolutely devastated , destroyed .
the so - called medina division , and the baghdad division .
the baghdad division , of course , getting its name from the fact that it is the republican guard division designated to defend principally baghdad .
four other divisions we are told have also been hit very , very very hard and are principally trying to reinforce units va also been hit very hard .
so we are seeing a lot of what some of the military officials are calling a method that does not seem to be directed by one person from the center of baghdad .
and that raises questions , questions that have been in front of us since that first strike on march 19th against the location that the cia military intelligence thought was a place where saddam hussein , perhaps his sons , were .
that pre ##em ##ptive strike they put , i think somewhat elegant ##ly , trying to strike at the head of the snake .
new explosions rocking parts of baghdad tonight .
we will continue to monitor that . we , of course , will bring the word to you just as soon as the army and coalition forces do take control of saddam hussein international airport , just on the outskirts of baghdad .

there are some significant differences in their strategy , including what role precisely the united nations should have in determining the future of iraq .
they ' ll try to thrash all of that out .
you ' re look at the picture of air force one taxi ##ing in on the tar ##mac , getting ready for the president .
as we watched this picture of the air force one getting into this airport i want to bring in our military analyst general dan cr ##isman to go over what happens happening in baghdad .
seems pretty far away from belfast right now , general .
but decisions that these two leaders make could have a significant impact on the future of iraq .
first of all , general , we ' ll keep this picture up of air force one , talk about what you sense is happening on the streets of baghdad right now .
wolf , it ' s clearly the final phase .
the eng ##ame which is un ##fo ##aling right now .
i think it ' s very significant not only in baghdad but bas ##ra itself .
you have coalition forces there in some strength .
apparently three ba tal ##ians of the u . s . 3rd division in baghdad three coalition assets , three huge battle groups in bas ##ra itself which the u . k . has there , what they ' ve developed here , wolf , over the last several weeks i very clear and increasingly clear intelligence as to what the final remnants of the regime leadership are in terms of where they are embedded in the cities .
what they ' re doing is going in now , very carefully , obviously some symbolic raids against palaces .
but the more important presence is to go after what intelligence delivers and that ' s where these key leaders are located .
they ' re going to be defended fan ##atic ##ally but intelligence is so crucial from aerial platforms and special ops personnel to give the three assets the intel which they need to close with and eliminate final remnants of the regime in those city ##s .
this is a very important final phase here , wolf , and it looks like the closure is coming here now more rapidly than we anticipated .
as we continue to watch air force one , now on the ground outside belfast , northern ireland , we ' ll be watching president bush emerge from the plane momentarily .
we ' ll continue to have live coverage of that .
when walter rodgers , our embedded reporter with the 3 - 7th cavalry says three battalions of troops are on the ground , inside baghdad itself , have taken up positions they ' re going to spend the night there presumably , how many soldiers are we talking about right now ?
between 700 and 1 , 000 .
the task forces really , wolf are probably built around the m - 2 bradley the basic infantry fighting vehicle .
it is the equipment of choice for a task force like this to go into baghdad . it ' s cannon , it ' s ability to imp ##lace troops and fire through the firing ports in that bradley vehicle to take them in under protection . it ' s a very , very important piece of equipment .
these are probably mechanized heavy task forces that have overhead aerial platforms to provide direct support .
it ' s significant the degradation of the iraqi air defenses has allowed a - 10 ##s , predators , u - s , other assets to hove ##r and lo ##iter and provide the overhead protection to these task

welcome back n case you ' re just tuning in , our top story this hour , the discovery of suspect chemical weapons materials at an agricultural complex in central iraq .
troops from the u . s . army ' s 101 ##st airborne division went to the site on friday , finding a number of large drums buried in bunker ##s .
initial tests were inc ##on ##clusive .
the general benjamin frankly of the 101 ##st says today a more sophisticated test indicated the presence of nerve and b ##list ##er agents .
he says that type of test that is required sometimes shows false - positive ##s and further testing will be done to determine whether the materials are indeed non ##we ##ap ##oni ##zed chemical agents or perhaps simply pest ##icides .

a live picture of the president united states landing at an air field in northern ireland .
once he gets out of the helicopter he ' ll transfer to air force one to come home after a 20 - hour visit with the prime minister of great britain .
they talked about a lot of things , about what peace in the middle east could look like , what post - war iraq could look like .
they talked about problems in northern ireland .
we ' re going to pause for a second to see if we see the president hopping off this chopper .
as you probably know , the prime minister of the great britain has been under great pressure at home and much of europe to support giving the united nations a very strong role in stab ##ili ##zing iraq .
the white house had signaled consistently it wants the united states and great britain to create a lead role .
we learned from john king , traveling with the president , that the new iraq run neither by u . s . / british coalition or united nations , but by the iraqi people . that some of what the prime minister and president shared with reporters at news conference following their meetings .
the president went on to say that an interim authority composed of iraq gr ##s inside and outside the country will run iraq until a permanent government can be established .
do you want to hang with the shot ?
okay , we ' re going to stay with this shot .
we ' ll talk more about what the two leaders discussed at the joint news conference following their series of meetings .
they really wanted to let folks who had any concerns about what the u . n . involvement might be to not worry .
they said there will definitely be some kind of role for the united nations , they think it ' s very important for the european nations to be on board with the plan , but once again , they very much view the future of iraq as being that in iraqi hands .
the president greeting a number of dignitaries as he gets ready here to board air force one on his way home .
a little earlier this morning , i spoke with an iraqi di ##ssi ##dent who teaches at writes extensively on the middle east .
he wrote a book called the republic of fear .
the politics of modern iraq .
and i asked him about the news that saddam hussein was targeted in yesterday ' s strike and how iraqi ##s would react if saddam was killed .

took it out early this morning .
here ' s what happened to him .
he was going on a mission south of baghdad when he was close to his target area , all of a sudden he heard a noise .

the pilot also was able to make a safe landing and neither of those pilots were hurt .
those are three planes hit today .
another a - 10 war ##th ##og was hit here today . that pilot was hit by at least one missile and some artillery .
we have video of that plane .

in were also big celebrations at ft . hood , texas , home base to two other p . o . w . s , david williams and ronald young . those pilots were captured on march 24th , after their apache helicopter went down in iraqi territory .
today , their families are learning new and actually harrow ##ing details about the days after their capture .
cnn national correspondent susan candi ##otti is with the young family in georgia , jamie cole by at ft . hood , texas , where she spoke to williams ' wife michelle .
susan , why do n ' t we start with you ?
reporter : hello , judy .
during a brief phone call with their son from kuwait on sur ##ng ##d the arm asked the young family not to get into any specific details about what happened during their son ' s capture and release .
however , the family did get in a company of questions about how he was treated . they learned he lost 20 pound pounds and also their son told them that in the last few days of his capture , things were n ' t so bad but that they were very rough in the beginning .
now they are learning more details that their son in fact was kicked and beaten after his capture , and that his fellow pilot david williams had a knife held to his throat immediately after an tu ##r , according to an interview their son was allowed to conduct with " the washington post " , who flew with him into kuwait .
their son is said to be in very good spirits now and back here in georgia , after three weeks of not knowing exactly what had happened to him , finally , for the very first time in three weeks , the young family members got some sleep last night for the first time in a long time .
well , at least some family members did .
she slept pretty good .
i ' m not kidding .
all right .
i came home , she was in bed , i laid on the couch for a couple of hours , walked around , i thought , i ' m going to sleep tonight , i really am .
i got in there , laid down ##er she must have took a pill or something .
sounded like a saw mill going on next to me .
back on the couch again .
hey , i was tired .
and besides , it was relief , you know ?
i could finally sleep and know everything was okay .
reporter : of course , pictures and video ##ta ##pe and a phone call is one thing .
but seeing their son in person is quite another .
and they are , of course , hoping that will happen very soon .
young ' s mother says , when she sees her son , she plans on hugging him for a good solid half hour .
back to you , judy .
at least , we would think , if that ' s the case .
thanks very much .
let ' s turn to jamie at ft . hood , texas , where she ' s been talking with the family of chief warrant officer david williams .
for them , jamie , begin what we just heard about the knife at his throat , they must be incredibly relieved .
reporter : you know , judy , they have been learning more and more as the day goes on .
the focus is clearly not on their treatment or their capture but their freedom .
i was on the phone with michelle williams yesterday , when she saw those first pictures on cnn of her husband , and she sleek ##ed with delight .
for three weeks she ' s watched and waited for some news .
the only other pictures was his abandoned helicopter . she knew instantly when she saw it , because of the 1st cavalry emblem and special markings it was his .
it ' s been a long three weeks .
today is date she was waiting for .
i ##hood a chance to spend some time with her yesterday .
this morning on " american morning " she told us about what her reaction was when she saw those first pictures of her husband free .
i was so happy .
he - - i knew i never lost hope that he was alive and just seeing him and being able to see his eyes and his reaction to his rescue just took a huge load off my shoulders .

d the extra $ 400 per child to american families this year , 2003 .
all together these tax reductions will help 92 million americans .
and a significant part of the benefit to our economy will come within the first two years of the plan .
a family of four with an income of $ 40 , 000 would receive a 96 % reduction in federal income taxes .
instead of paying $ 1 , 178 per year , the family would pay $ 45 a year .
[ applause ] that means extra money in the family budget year after year .
that money can cover a lot of bills . that money can help families with purchases they have been delaying . that money will be in circulation , which will be good for our economy . [ applause ] and this plan will help our small business sector .
the benefits of the growth plan will come from un ##cre ##ase ##d consumer spending and , as importantly , from a lower income tax rates on the small businesses themselves .
it is important for our fellow citizens to understand that most small businesses pay their business taxes at the individual rates .
most small businesses are sole proprietor ##ship ##s , limited partnerships , are sub ##cha ##pt ##er ss , and , therefore , when you reduce individual tax rates , you benefit small business formation .
as a matter of fact , under this plan , some 23 million small business owners will see their taxes cut .
which leaves more money for investment , more money for growth , more money for job creation .
a growing economy also needs small business investment .
and our tax code should encourage investment .
today a small business can de ##du ##ct a maximum of $ 25 , 000 in the year in which they buy equipment .
we need to triple the amount that can be de ##ducted in the year in which they buy equipment .
[ applause ]
so i propose to congress that they ought to limit - - limit ought to be increased to $ 75 , 000 and that limit ought to be indexed to inflation . by doing so , we promote greater investment in machinery .
and when a small business bias machine that enhance ##s their company ' s product di ##v ##ty as well as it means machinery manufacturer is likely to have more work available .
more investment equals jobs .
and what we are interested in in this administration is helping people who look for work find a job .
[ applause ]
we can also promote economic growth and job creation by removing the double tax on divide ##nds .
[ applause ]
taxi ##ng corporate income once is fair .
it is not fair for the federal government to tax the same money twice .
the burden of double taxation falls on the millions of individuals who receive divide ##nds .
falls especially hard on seniors who receive half of all divide ##nd income .
removal of double taxation would put more money in the hands of investors .
it would encourage more investment in american businesses .
economists say that this plan will help our stock markets , and since half of american families own stock , the reform will help them save and help our economy grow .
now , these measures were presented to congress in the first week of this year .
the pro growth package was urgent in january .
it ' s even more urgent today .
[ applause ] it is important for you all to understand and for our fellow americans to understand the tax relief that i have proposed and will push for until enacted would create - - [ applause ] will create 1 . 4 million new jobs by the end of 2004 .
in two years time , this nation has experienced war , a recession and a national emergency . which has caused our government to run a deficit .
the best way to reduce the deficit is with more growth in our economy , which means more revenues to our treasury , and less spending in washington , d . c . [ applause ] i am pleased that both the house and senate have passed budget resolutions that show real spending restraint .
and now the congress must focus on a robust and effective growth package .
we need at least $ 550 billion in that package because the more tax relief that goes to the american people , the more jobs we will create in this economy .
[ applause ] the last few months have been a time of challenge for america .
our resolve has been tested .
yet we have the great resources of national strength .
and national character .
to overcome every challenge we face .
our confidence an our optimism have never wai ##vered .
we are defending the peace of the world .
we ' re bringing freedom to corners of the world who have n ' t seen freedom in years .
we ' re all building the prosperity of our country .
this is a unique moment in our history and the american people are rising to meet it .
i want to thank each of you for your hard work .
i want to thank each of you for the faith you have shown in this country ' s future .
may god bless you , and may god continue to bless america .

the coroner examining the remains of two bodies recovered near san francisco bay yesterday was unable to determine the cause of death .
police are now considering the possibility that the remains are those of lac ##i peterson and her un ##born child .
peterson disappeared on christmas eve of last year .
paul ve ##rca ##mme ##n joins me now from martinez , california , with the latest for us .
paul ?
reporter : well , lou , one thing that the coroner has been able to determine is that the skeletal remains are those of one , an adult female , and two , the remains of the almost full - term baby boy .
and of course , this is significant because lac ##i peterson , when she disappeared from her modest ##o home , was 7 1 / 2 months pregnant .
that was on christmas eve .
her husband , scott , at the time said that he was fishing in the berkeley marina .
now , in a strange twist in all of this , just yesterday separate from the skeletal remains i all ##uded to earlier a man hiking near the berkeley marina found a bone , and they are now looking at that as another possible lead in this case .
this person came across the bone at the shore .
he brought it home and contacted the authorities , and we took possession of it . and you ' re trying to connect it to the other - -
well , we ' re trying to find out if it ' s a human bone and whether or not it is related to the others .
reporter : and yet another reason why that bone could be a key link , there are reports that have surfaced that in terms of the female remains that were found the skeleton was not completely intact .
now this case is also taking on a rather , we should say , almost a tv ep ##iso ##dic forensic pathology angle because they ' re going to bring in an expert on what ' s called al ##uf ##ating decay , and basically this person is going to come in here and look at the body .
this is in the damage aspect of it .
and they say these experts will be able to tell how long the body had been in there and if the remains of the almost full - term baby boy were inside the female ' s remains at the time of death .
also , the coroner could know right now but is not saying if there was some sort of trauma to either of these skeletons , for example , if they could see the bone compromised in some way they could tell if there had been a stab or a shooting .
we may learn a lot more on this in just 15 minutes .
that ' s because modest ##o police have scheduled a news conference and while they may not say much at all they could also drop some major bomb shells , lou .
reporting live from martinez , california , i ' m paul ve ##rca ##mme ##n , now back to you .
paul , let me ask you , if i may , quickly , are we expecting - - is there any reason for us to expect that there would be the ability to identify those remains as a result of these auto ##ps ##ies this afternoon ?
reporter : it sounds like all of this will be too quick , and it seems underlying all this is there could be an absence of dental records .
that ' s particularly important for the adult female remains .
so now they ' re going to have to turn to dna , and that ' s why they ' re calling in these experts . some dna testing can be very quick , but sometimes it can take up to weeks , even more , lou .
okay .
paul ve ##rca ##mme ##n , thank you very much .
as paul just reported , the modest ##o , california police department will be holding a news conference just a few minutes from now , and cnn of course will be carrying that news conference live . stay with us .

one is the capture of number 24 as it ' s described , sami ##r who is responsible for the baghdad district , indications are the ku ##rds in the north handed this man over so this is number 4 out of that playing card deck of 55 that the u . s . is after .
top leaders in iraq .
also that bomb site in baghdad hit about a week and a half ago , the mans ##our district .
no remains identified just yet , general brooks says , but only the initial surveys have been completed so far .
there is strong speculation that saddam hussein may be his two sons were inside of that building when it was hit by coalition bombs , or may have left prior to the bombing taking place .
again , all this is an outstanding issue right now .
in the north , you ' re going to hear a lot about the shallow graves today .
at least 1500 , maybe 1600 graves located in the north .

they do n ' t know when to expect him back , and have been told he faces lots of questions .

he was a normal person , he says .
a good neighbor , but a bad politician .
at their nearby store , they prepare to open for their first day of business since the war .
aziz was a politician he said .
it ' s saddam and the others americans have problems with .
maybe he gives us information about the missing people , and perhaps saddam hussein .
further down the road , these men wait for a ride .
neither have anything bad to say about aziz .
we call him mr . aziz , and i ' m proud of him , says this former traffic cop .
he was culture ##d , and i wish someone like him rules us .
his friend adds , if all the leaders stayed in baghdad , then the americans will catch them .

he should get the death penalty , just like saddam , 60 times over .
we give mr . bush six months to get things right he says , going on to explain , if not , we will fight the americans .
the biggest problem tar ##iq aziz ' family says they now face is that aziz is now safely in u . s . custody , they do n ' t know how safe they are out on baghdad ' s streets .

if you ' re investing , why now ?
chi ##tch ##at in the time life building here at ao ##l and all over wall street , ted turner selling 60 million shares for $ 800 million , more than half of his stake in the company , he opens 40 million plus now .
question is , why ?
why is he selling ?
i think he ' s begin up .
he ' s at least - - he ##d ##ging his bets by keeping 40 million shares but basically he ' s decided that the company is not going wait he wants it to go and he ' s bail ##ing out .
you know , a lot of concern obviously by people who still own the stock .
my point about this , if ted turner were so smart and he ' s a very smart guy but he did not sell at the top , okay ?
he did n ' t sell at $ 60 .
hind sight would have like to have gotten that .
he believed in the merger like most other people did .
we ' ll look back five years from now , you can see , he has lost a lot of money .
you know , he still had $ 1 . 7 billion , we ' re not shed ##ding tears .
he did have $ 8 billion .
he ' s left a lot on the table .
we ' ll look back five years from now and say , when the stock is either at $ 13 still or $ 8 or $ 30 and say , he was either very smart or not smart at all .
he ' s still he ##d ##ging his bet by keeping 40 million stake .
i hope he ' s wrong .
me , too .
the question , i ' m an ao ##l shareholder sitting at home , hearing this news , done this set off a few alarms ? will people panic and everybody sell it ?
i think the stock will be weaker today .
again , you know , the stock has drifted below $ 10 .
it ' s been in the neighborhood for a while .

we ' ll continue to watch this cr ##am ##ma un ##fold off key la ##rgo in florida . let ' s much on to another important story .
it ' s happened , of course , several times during the war in iraq , journalists caught in the line of fire and killed .
israeli troops are facing a similar situation with two journalists killed in just the past two weeks .
here ' s cnn ' s cl ##y wallace .
reporter : friday night in the gaza strip and a journalist is about to lose his life .
shortly after several shots are heard an israeli bull ##do ##zer can be seen uncover ##ing the israelis say , a tunnel used to smug ##gle weapons .
moments later , three journalists who were covering that israeli action appear .
one with tv labeled on the back of a bullet - proof vest , another carrying a white flag .
judging from the video ##ta ##pe , they appear difficult to see in the darkness .
and difficult to hear .
after the journalists shout , another gunshot .
moments later , another shot and the sound of someone in pain .
34 - year - old british journalist james miller died on the scene after israeli soldiers come to his aid , the israeli defense sources says .
he is best known for his work on two award - winning documentaries which appeared on cnn exposing the world to the taliban rule in afghanistan .
now the foreign press association in israel is calling for an independent investigation .
james was not shooting and he was not with somebody shooting .
so , again , to know exactly what happened we need a full - fledged inquiry .
the israeli government said its forces were returning fire and that miller was shot in the back , suggesting he could have been hit by palestinian gunmen .
those close to miller believe he was shot by an armored israeli personnel carrier .
we know the israelis fired .
whether or not he was shot by israelis gunfire , we are not certain at this time .
miller becomes the second journalist in just two weeks to be killed covering the israeli - palestinian conflict .
with palestinian camera ##men , shot and killed by an israeli soldier on the west bank in mid - april . with back - to - back deaths making a total of at least seven journalists killed covering the conflict in the past two and a half years .
this is very worrying and i believe the israeli army should take special measures to prevent this .
the message from the israeli government is that its soldiers are not targeting journalists , but that journalists who travel to places where there could be live fire exchange between israeli forces and palestinian gunmen have a responsibility to take greater precautions .
they have to realize that this is not a game going on there .
it ' s a life and death situation .
soldiers are basically thinking about their own lives at that moment .
they do n ' t have time to hesitate .
the israeli spokesman says the soldier his no choice , but to be there . journalists say

" vanity fair ' s " come lu ##mist daniel fair is here .
quit ##ing in the june edition , he describes the journey .
he said he found evidence that hussein ' s day of reckon ##ing well over due .
christopher hitch ##ens joins us from california .
good to have you with us .
thanks for having me .
your journey , particularly to southern iraq , what is ev ##oked there a sense of both that you ev ##oke is a sense of history of this regime .
give us your insights as to what you think the future holds .
do you mean if i start with the past ?
not at you will .
not at all i .
not much of a trip .
i was n ' t up the sharp end .
i was n ' t taking risks .
i was n ' t in a position that my dear friend was in when he was killed outside bag ##dad airport but i had long thought and i was in iraq in the previous war that really all the talk that had been about the rush to war , the push for war , the drive for war , all that propaganda , was essentially non ##sen ##sic ##al because in 1990 , saddam hussein made the only self criticism .
he said , i could either invade kuwait or finish developing the nuclear weapon . maybe before the weapon and then later he said , oh , i should have got the nuclear weapon before i invaded .
he was right about that .
but that means that he inaugurated at that point like a dozen - year ' s war where the united states could be criticized for doing too little and acting too slowly but all we ' re arguing about lately is to do with those that should have been finished in ' 91 when it could have been finished .
should have taken the side of the rebels then .
taken the risk of supporting a shi ##ite insurrection at that point .
helping the ku ##rds , removing the regime .
absolutely .
we ' d be 11 years into nation building by now if we ' d done that .
that seems to be the core of the argument .
as you point out , of course , for the fact of the matter is , the mistakes of saddam hussein made possible his removal from power ultimately .
the mistakes of the united states , again , as you point out , norman schwarz ##ko ##pf making a peace , permitting helicopters to fly .
still hurts me to read this .
the little town i was in this southern iraq , as far as i got , i ca n ' t bo ##ast of further , is where the talks took place .
we have the transcript of the meeting .
they say , okay , we have lost this round .
do you mind if we keep your helicopters in the air just to be able to transport things ?
and he says , yeah , that ' s all right .
they ask again , are you sure they mean that ?
they ca n ' t believe the luck .
they use the guns ##hips to kill , we think , not less than 50 , 000 inhabitants of southern iraq and trying to do that to the ku ##rds , as well , so it was a knife edge .
and it ' s not just been wise after the event , i believe , to say that there was an argument in real ##time between the bush administration members .
mr . cheney ' s the only one i know that changed his mind .
most of those that took the view at that time , think until recently they were correct in saving saddam hussein .
of course , mr . cheney was in the chain of command with sw ##ars cough and - -
many others .
when they made the decision not to move toward bag ##dad with bad information .
namely , the republican guard absolutely devastated .
yes .
and , well , we know now the harvest of all that .
it hurts to think of how many wonderful people in iraq at the academic community , lawyers , human rights activists , civilians , intellectuals , people - - would now be alive .
who have been horribly murdered and tortured and reduced to misery since by a half application of violence through sanctions and over ##flight ##s .
mistakes made then , mistakes part of human experience , but now we have an opportunity not to make mistakes .
is it your sense that the united states is on the right track ?
that there is the prospect here a commitment here on the part of the united states to

a former fbi informant accused of being a double agent has been indicted .
the charges against katrina leung are the latest in an alleged case of sex , spies , and international int ##rigue .
charles feldman is in los angeles with details on this one .
reporter : this is a story that has made the fbi look - - well , kind of do ##pe ##y .
it has put a spotlight on u . s . / china relations .
like any good spy movie , it ' s already had a sequel with the first indictment earlier in the week and another one just yesterday .
on thursday , the other shoe dropped .
just one day after a former fbi counter ##int ##elli ##gence agent was indicted on charges of gross negligence , his mistress of two decades , katrina leung , was herself indicted on more serious charges of copying and possessing documents relating to the national security of the united states .
documents she allegedly lifted on many occasions from the briefcase of her ex - fbi handler , james smith .
leung ' s lawyers wasted little time responding to the grand jury indictment .
katrina leung is no matt ah ##ar ##ry , as people have suggested .
she was recruited actively by the fbi because of what she could do and because of what she knew .
she d not go out to get this job .
reporter : leung , a prominent chinese - american , was practically the toast of l . a .
she was seemingly present for just about every event involving local politicians , sometimes national ones , and various high - ranking officials of the chinese government .
that part , at least , was by design .
leung was hired by the fbi and paid almost $ 2 million over 20 years to spy on the chinese .
federal prosecutors now say she pulled a fast one and actually sp ##ied on the u . s . for the chinese .
this case is a major embarrassment

there ' s some shocking new information about the life of john f . kennedy , both before and during his days in the white house .
the revelations are part of a just published biography about the 35th president .
our jonathan karl takes a look inside the pages .
reporter : the revelations about kennedy ' s alleged affair with an intern make up just a couple lines in historian robert dow ##d ' s 700 - plus page biography .
the information comes from a single source , an interview with a former kennedy staff ##er who says she does not remember the intern ' s last game .
although he finds the reports of kennedy ' s woman ##izing credible , he believes new information about kennedy ' s health problems is more significant .
j ##fk ' s public image was one of youthful vigor but in truth he battled serious medical problems his entire life .
twice before becoming president he was so sick , a priest was brought in to give him last rites .
while researching his new book on j ##fk , dal ##lic uncovered previously sealed medical records that detailed the ek tent of his medical troubles and the lengths he went to conceal them from the public .
there are many stories about politicians who used political influence to get out of military conflict .
but dal ##lic shows he you ##ed his family ' s influence to get into the navy just as america was on the verge of world war ii .
in 1941 , he flu ##nk ##ed two military medical exams .
his powerful father intervened , getting yet another exam .
reading the report of his exam , one would think he never had a serious physical problem in his life .
it was a complete white ##wash that would never have been possible without his father ' s help .
kennedy entered the navy earning hero status for saving his ship mates when his boat pt - 109 was sunk by the japanese .
dal ##le ##k says kennedy ' s brushes with death , combined with his t deaths of his sister and brother , fueled the ambition to led him to become the youngest person elected president in american history .
kennedy told a friend before he entered politics , you ' ve got to live every day like it ' s your last day on earth .
that ' s what i ' m doing .

we are back .
it ' s been a few days since we had any new developments in the lac ##i peterson case .
it appears we do have something to talk about this morning .
perhaps a search for some new evidence under way .
let ' s check in with our rusty do ##rn ##in , out in modest ##o , california , with the latest on that .
reporter : we knew it was a matter of time before police got back into the water in san francisco bay looking for more evidence in the lac ##i peterson case .
that happened this morning .
numerous agency r agencies boats with sonar technology and divers into san francisco bay .
they came from the richmond marina as well as the ur ##bu ##ina ##no island , the coast guard station .
it ' s being used as a staging area .
they are going to be launching a search for what may be left in the bay here now .
as you know about a month ago lac ##i peterson ' s body washed up right here . an area called point isabelle .
right across the channel here is an area known as brooks island .
they believe - - police say that is where scott peterson told them that he did go fishing the day that lac ##i peterson did disappear .
now , a source close to the investigation has told me that what they are really looking for are concrete anchors or weights which may have parts of lac ##i peterson ' s body or clothing or something attached to it .
that they did discover a concrete weight in scott peterson ' s wear ##house .
if it matched , that would be something that could link scott peterson - - it would be like a smoking gun in this case .
inevitably they are looking for something linked to lac ##i peterson , whether

a series of commercials people are not as fond of featuring carrot top as he pitches for one of the oldest and most reared corporations in the land , at & amp ; t .
we ' re training here ?
train your finger to dial up the center .
it ' s free for you , and cheap for them .
carrot top ' s major exposure on the tube is n ' t just something that makes us curious . " fortune " magazine looked into his commercial appeal .
there must be some .
andy can explain why he ' s a hot commodity .
no , i ca n ' t explain at all .
i want to sound off .
this blows my mind .
probably the most annoying person on the planet .
i do n ' t say that lightly .
the most annoying person on the planet .
here is this old blue chip company that uses him as a pitch man .
i ' ve never heard of this guy before they started doing these commercials .
now he ' s more and more famous .
he ' s hitting on girls , advertising long distance . what this is carrot top ?
does anyone like carrot top ?
it ' s disgusting .
i actually - - he flew under my radar .
i called atlanta to get background on this guy .
the san francisco chronicle did a survey with its readers of most annoying celebrities famous for just being famous .
carrot top .
kathy lee gifford number two .
he has n ' t a celebrity until at & amp ; t ever made him one .
anybody call you carrot top ?
auburn top ?
nobody ' s a celebrity until the media makes him one .
do n ' t be picking on my friend susan .
you ' re really exercised about this .
he ' s trying to make a living .
has somebody from your magazine spent time with him ?
yes , and hates him as much as everyone else does .
he spent time with this guy and there was stockholm syndrome , he ended up liking the guy .
maybe he ' s a nice guy , it does n ' t have to be stockholm syndrome .
in defense of carrot top , he knows he ' s insane and annoying and acknowledges it .
he wrote carrot top is one of those c list celebrities who worm ##ed their way into your consciousness without you knowing how it happened .
here ' s a story about a kid who ' s stormed into our consciousness , le ##bron james .
the high school basketball ph ##eno ##m out of ohio .
he just signed , only 18 , a senior , has not played one nano ##se ##con ##d in the nba yet .
yet already signed a sneak ##er deal that ap reports is worth more than $ 90 million .
le ##bron james is expected to be cleveland ' s top pick after they won the number one pick in the nba lottery . nike is hoping the ph ##eno ##m will help boost their sales of basketball shoes to that crucial team market .
and of course everybody ' s got an opinion whether the kid is going to skip college and go right into the pro ##s , worth this kind of money .
this is mega bucks .
they only paid tiger woods $ 40 million for his deal coming out of stanford university .
but he had an amateur golf career where he posted scores and did things comparable to what is done on the pga tour . nobody knows if this kid can play against sha ##quil ##le o ' neal or not .
nike and nba are looking for the next big thing .
it ' s not only of course his basketball skills , which is un ##quest ##ion ##able .
but his personality .
then if in fact the team he ultimately plays on , whether the cleveland cavaliers , or somebody else , whether they actually are any good .

as we said , earlier this week , christine todd whitman stepped do ##up and now a whole lot of analysis is taking place as to why she stepped down , the job she ' s done when she was in office and the job that has yet to be complete .
from our new york bureau as i was introducing a moment ago , dan fa ##gen , the environment writer for news day and dan , whitman did consider herself sort of the republican environmental ##ist . but now there ' s been an awful lot of monday night quarterback quarterback ##ing taking place now that she ' s te ##ped down .
what do you suppose took place here ?
i think many people have watched this ##stra ##tion in action and watched chi ##s tee whitman in action .
the mystery is that she took the job in the first place or did n ' t leave earlier .
she was quite a mis ##fi ##t for this administration , and she showed that over and over .
she was not good at all at communicating the administration ' s message to the public and certainly to the environmental groups and she was even worse at bringing the epa bureaucracy , the epa environmental policy makers ' message to this administration because she saw herself under ##cut over and over .
that ' s interesting because leading into it , while she was new jersey governor , she sued the epa and she was very much considering herself to be an environmental ##ist , and then only to end up becoming the head of the epa and then of course , there was a lot of criticism over relaxed regulations .
let ' s hear what she had to say last wednesday here on cnn just after announcing her resignation .
i ' m not leaving because of clashes with the administration , in fact , i have n ' t had any .
i report to the president , and he has always asked me to give him my best una ##du ##lter ##ated advice .
we have have been on the same page .
i was never supportive of protocol because it did n ' t do what everyone needs to get done as far as climate change is concerned . i ' m leaving now because it ' s the appropriate time to do it .
dan , do you agree with that ?
she says the appropriate time .
do you suppose for personal reasons or perhaps she was out of step with the administration ?
i ' m sure that it was difficult for her personally , but i think the commuter marriage perhaps would have been less stress ##ful if everyday she did n ' t see herself being undermine ##d and over ##ru ##led ##ded .
i mean if christy whitman and the white house were on the same page , i do n ' t think i ' ve seen a book large enough to contain a page that big .
over and over there were many , many instances over the last

let ' s talk a little bit more about what the navy does to prevent such tr ##aged ##ies .
we were talking about it this morning and we put together some graphics for you .
i ' ll try to explain it the best i can from what i remember from being on the " uss abraham lincoln " this is an amphibious ship , rather , but this is what the navy does with regard to prevention .
everybody that is , every sailor that ' s enters ##ing the navy does take a swim test .
they learn how to tread water and do the dead man float and they have to pass that in order to continue on .
also drills take place before sailors get on to any ship , before any deployment , usually twice a day , they ' re practicing man overboard drills , knowing where to go , where to report to if indeed a man overboard takes place and as the deployment begins , those wan ##e off , but they know where to go quickly .
they also wear float coats .
you can see them here .
the yellow shirt is wearing a yellow float coat .
everything is color coordinated .
you see the gentleman here wearing a brown one and they have to ##ggles to pull and in ##fl ##ate .
they also have a manual device so if the to ##ggles do n ' t work they can blow air into the inflation device .
they have dive go ##ggles and they ' re able to find them .
it also has a st ##ro ##be light and a whistle .
also such location devices , some ship have smoke floats they can toss out so the man overboard will be able to use smoke signals as a way of trying to find or locate , let the rescue ##r locate them .
also 24 / 7 there are individuals on watch .
all throughout the ship , all around the ship .
and indeed , there is netting on most parts of the ship , not on entire all around the entire ship , but on most parts there is a very thick netting .
now let ' s talk about the man overboard rescue and when indeed there is a man overboard situation .
you will hear a p . a .
announcement around the entire ship .
there is a man overboard so everyone knows they have to react quickly .
a ship - wide search will happen f . they do n ' t see that person go overboard , but if indeed they do see someone go overboard , the ship starts to circle that area continuously .
also small boats sometimes go out into the water , but even more importantly , helicopters are launched immediately .
inside those helicopters rescue im ##sw ##im ##mers .
if indeed the man overboard is located , well the ho ##ister is dropped down with usually a torso harness .
if the man overboard is injured then they may use a basket , but more than likely those swimmers will go right into the water and try and help the swimmer hook up on that harness and pull them up into the he ##lo and pull them back on to the ship for treatment and usually a search takes about 24 hours .
the search crews will go 24 hours before calling off that search .
why call it off ?
there ' s a number of reasons to look at .
depending on the water temperature , it ' s very possible that or very common in cold water that someone will not survive a certain amount of time .
also the reason for the 24 - hour search is they fail they ' ve exhausted all resources by that time .
anyway , we ' ll continue to follow what ' s happening on the " uss nassau " as those investigations continue for the two missing sailors .

adrenaline is high on the flight deck of this carrier at war .
soon after dawn on this fourth day , confirmation of the ship ' s first strike .
fourth day of combat operations today bore fruit for the air wing and the ship team here .
we had f - 14 aircraft drop laser - guided bombs , f - 18 ##s drop joint direct attack munitions or j - dam weapons into eastern afghanistan today this is the first of an unknown number of strikes we ' ll conduct during our watch in " operation enduring freedom . "
they ' ll come back high fi ##ving and feeling pretty good about it but it is a bit of a somber event that they ' re going through out here .
but the biggest thing you ' re seeing is the intensity .
reporter : the fighter jets dropped their ordnance in a coordinated ata ##ck on a convoy near the afghan city of cho ##ft .
the pentagon says the convoy was taliban and al qaeda troops .
there was an attack on a convoy of leadership that was identified through various intelligence means .
that was done within the last 24 hours .
reporter : but the strikes prove controversial .
local afghan ##s in the convoy say it was a group of elders on their way to the inaugural ceremony for interim afghan leader hamid ka ##rza ##i .
analysts believe some tribal warlord ##s may have taken advantage of american fire ##power by accuse ing ri ##fe aa ##l leaders of being taliban and mis ##gui ##ding u . s . intelligence .
the consequence of injuring or hurting someone who is friendly or non ##par ##tic ##ip ##ant in combat is very difficult to deal with .
a . and we go extreme details in - - and do a lot of training as well to make sure that does n ' t happen .
we have dropped ordnance today .

a defense attorney calls it his worst nightmare .
a convicted murderer is released from prison before serving his full sentence and then a nightmare becomes reality .
it happened last week .
michael sears was determined to prove he was no longer a threat .
his psychiatrist backed him up .
serious was serving a 30 - year sentence for the self - confessed 1992 killing of his wife in clinton , maryland , but after a relentless campaign that included a letter from his psychiatrist saying serious was unlikely to commit such violence again , the judge in this case , got him released .
he served less than nine years .
maryland is the only state that allows un ##che ##cked judicial rec ##ons ##ider ##ation , allowing judges to reduce prison terms at any time after sentencing .
those favor ##ing the rule say it gives convicts incentive to behave in prison and enables judges to release prisoners if new evidence comes to light .
at some point after his release , michael serious befriended a woman named dar ##lene williamson .
last week williamson , a mother of four , was found stabbed to death at a condom ##inium in green ##belt , maryland .
the official resident of that condo , the man now charged with her murder , michael serious .
today the judge in the case retired prince georges county circuit court judge issued a statement to the news media .
he called the case and i ' m quoting now , a judge ' s worst nightmare , but he noted that maryland parole boards and the facility where michael serious was held , the institution made what the judge called the final decision on whether to release serious .
the psychiatrist , by the way , who wrote a letter on michael serious ' behalf , neil blu ##mberg had a two - word response in an article in the washington post .
my goodness , he was pretty surprised .
serious ' defense attorney who persuaded the judge reduce the sentence , told the post and i ' m quoting , i ' m very sad ##dened . it makes me sick as a defense attorney .
as a defense attorney it ' s your worst nightmare .
let ' s get perspective on this shocking case . glen i ' ve ##y is the prince georges county , maryland , state attorney .
it does n ' t get more shocking than this .
how could this happen ?

moving ahead now to a developing story , the hunt for so - called smoking gun , meant to prove that iraq was developing weapons of mass destruction .
here ' s national security correspondent david en ##sor .
reporter : while u . s . forces still have n ' t found any weapons of mass destruction , the new cia pentagon report says officials are now confident the mysterious trucks filled with high - tech equipment found in iraq are indeed mobile biological weapons production facilities , just as secretary of state powell predicted and presented the united nations before the war .
it ' s very important to recognize that programs that we had said existed do exist .
reporter : though no trace of biological toxin was found in the trucks , u . s . intelligence officials say they have largely eliminated any other possible use for the fe ##rm ##enter ##s and other equipment .
not everyone is convinced .
they could very well be biological weapons production facilities , but i do n ' t think the intelligence community has made an open and shut case .
reporter : the cia - pentagon reports admits the trucks were not an efficient way to produce biological weapons , but officials argue the point for the iraqi ##s was to produce some and not to be caught doing it .
this was clearly a very in ##ef ##fi ##cie ##nt way to produce ant ##hra ##x . and the question is why did they invest such resources in a mobile

five motions are being heard today in the case of lee boyd mal ##vo , the teenage sniper suspect .
one for a change of venue .
defense attorneys argue that there has been so much pre ##tri ##al publicity , including an alleged confession from mal ##vo , that this has tainted the jury pool . their more intriguing argument is that one of the charges against mal ##vo is under virginia ' s anti - terrorism statute and they argue that every resident of fairfax county is potentially a member of the victim ' s class .
and therefore , disqualified from serving as a ju ##ror . the prosecutor will argue against this motion .
he calls it factual ##ly pro po ##s truss .
if history is any guide , this motion will have a tough time .
no case has been moved out of fairfax county since 1974 .
there also is a motion to dismiss this case .
defense attorneys argue that an individual can not be charged under federal law and then state law for the same act .
prosecutors again will argue against the motion .
three other motions as well .
one of those for a handwriting expert , the other motions relate to getting background information relating to ballistic ##s testing and dna testing .
mal ##vo on trial here in fairfax county for the murder of linda franklin , the fbi analyst who was gunn ##ed down in a home depot parking lot .

that standing o ##vation that sammy so ##sa got at wr ##ig ##ley field last night .
a major league baseball official is skilled ##ded to conduct interviews in chicago .
those interviews could be a factor as the league decides how sammy so ##sa will be punished for using a court - filled bat .
our gary tu ##chman is live .
good morning .
reporter : the cub ' s player this afternoon , once again , sammy so ##sa will be in the lineup but he could find out as early as today what his punishment will be and how many games he ' ll be suspend for .
last night when he went to play for the first time , most of the fans on wr ##ig ##ley field gave him a standing o ##vation .
in all fairness , not all of them totally believed sammy so ##sa but he ' s a hero here and they want to believe sammy so ##sa .
he hit the ground ball on the first inning , that scored a run , but the run was taken away .
so ##sa was quick ##ed out of the game after he was found out he had a cork during the bat .
he meant not to use it during the game , but he did use it during the game .
major league baseball took 76 of his bats and x - ray ##ed them for cork .
those x race were negative .
that was conducted by a trained radio ##logical technician .
we believe the x - ray process was sufficient to determine the state of those bats and we ' re very confident that all of those bats were clean and had no foreign substances within them .
it was a mistake .
we ' re all human and we all made a mistake .
nobody ' s perfect in this world upon .
reporter : last night with the bat , we assumed was not cork , sammy so ##sa struck out the first three times up .
he did hit a single in the ninety inning in a losing effort for the chicago cubs .
back to you .
there ' s a concern with the huge series there this weekend with the yankees coming to town that sammy would be suspended during that .
the yankees vp ##ts been to wr ##ig ##ley field since the 1930s since they played the cubs in the 1930s .
so ##sa could get a suspension , but he could appeal suspension .
so if he wanted to play against the yankees , he probably will be able to .

thanks so much .

that ' s the verdict after baseball officials x - ray ##ed sam why so ##sa ' s entire inventory of bat and found no evidence of cork or any other substance .
that seems to support his contention that the bat got him ejected tuesday night was a flu ##ke .
still a decision on what , if any punishment he will face in the wake of that incident tuesday night .
gary tu ##chman standing by in chicago , with the latest on the so ##sa saga outside of wr ##ig ##ley field .
reporter : leon , hello to you .
three hours from now the chicago cubs take the field against the tampa bay devil rays here at wr ##ig ##ley field and sammy so ##sa will be out there with them but how long will he ?
we could find out today . his punishment , suspension for using a cork ##ed bat for use - - which is illegal during a game .
since the incident 33 , 000 fans in the stands for a night game he received a standing o ##vation from almost all of them .
i heard a few boo ##s but almost everyone standing .
not everyone believing this man ' s story , which is it was a mistake but he ' s a hero here .
these people want to believe his story .
it happened tuesday night .
in the first inning he hit a ground ball . scored a run .
when he hit the ball , the bat broke .
the umpire ##s found cork in the bat .
it ' s illegal because when you put it in the bat it makes the meat lighter .
they hollow out the bat and stick the cork in there to mask the hollow sound .
then you can swing it lighter and you can swing it faster .
they took 76 of his bats for analysis . they x - ray ##ed the bats .
the x - rays all came back negative . but did major league baseball have all of sammy so ##sa ' s bats ?
we are , as i said , confident , based on not only the presence of security in the club house but also the level of cooperation , the record keeping that we reviewed and so forth , that we have all of the bats .
so i do n ' t want anyone to mis ##con ##st ##ru ##e what i said .
it is con ##ce ##iva ##ble because we did n ' t have physical presence in the club house that we do not have them all but we are very confident that we do .
i ' m man enough to take everything that i ' ve done for .
and i still walk yesterday like a man and take the blame .
but the media today , they got it like i ' m a criminal and that ' s something that really bothered me and hurt me as a man .
reporter : now , why did sammy so ##sa have this cork ##ed bat ? well , he says he has it because he uses it for batting practice to put on a show for the fans .
they asked him how many times he ' s used it during batting practice and he says three or four times .
that raises the question does major league baseball have a rule about using cork ##ed bats during batting practice .

only his day in court wo n ' t come until january 2005 .
lawyers for the three men arrested with him say they need that much time to go over the government ' s evidence and prepare their case .
two of the indicted men are out on bond , but sami ##el aryan and other defendant are held without bond which is to say they will stay in jail until the trial starts in roughly 18 months .
this conflict over individual liberty and national security is hardly new .
president lincoln dealt with it during the civil war , f . d . r .
did in world war ii , and it is often true that decisions made in the heat of a moment , a war or after an attack look pretty good at the time , not so good as time passes .
whether that is true now , we can not say .

it ' s good .
it ' s useful .
it ' s appealing .
it ' s attractive and it ' s cheap .
reporter : even as km ##art struggled through financial difficulties , stewart stuck by the company .
it ' s hard to run out on a partner that ' s down .
that ' s not our style .
reporter : now stewart is hoping people do n ' t run out on her .
the celebrity indicted on charges stemming from the sale of im ##cl ##one stock .
stewart and former im ##cl ##one ceo sam wa ##ks ##al shared a broker who now also faces charges of obstruction of justice and per ##ju ##ry .
her defense has been that she had a standing sell order at $ 60 and when the stock fell below 60 the broker supposed to , you know make the trade .
she ' s been standing with that story .
the broker standing by that story .
the only reason it ' s not holding is because there are other people that the merrill lynch that investigated and did n ' t find proof that was actually the case .
reporter : after stewart was charged by federal authorities wednesday , her lawyers issued a statement in which they said , quote , martha stewart has done nothing wrong .
the accusation that martha stewart sold the im ##cl ##one shares based on inside information proved to be false .
if she lied , then that is the obstruction of justice charge .
that ' s the criminal side .
that ' s where the prison time comes in .
reporter : for stewart , the fallout from the past year taken a tremendous toll .
martha stewart told me that the investigation itself had cost her about $ 400 million .
in decline in her stock , legal fees , and lost business opportunities .
reporter : ironic , considering the sale of the im ##cl ##one stock resulted in a gain of less than $ 50 , 000 .
she ' ll never fully recover .
you know , it ' s almost like e . g . you get off the hook , but are you really off the hook because people always believe you were guilty .
and it ' s hard to win back that sort of brand equity that she ' s lost .
reporter : stewart is vow ##ing to clear her name of the charges .
she is so focused and so determined that this investigation , while terribly upset ##ting , has not been something that ' s stood in her way .
as only she would , she said , look , i do n ' t lose any sleep .
i still sleep my three or four hours a night .
reporter : he says stewart is still taken aback by the reaction to her legal troubles .
i think she ' s been stunned at how much joy so many people have taken at her mis ##fort ##une .
she does n ' t quite understand that the perfection ##ism that made her so famous also makes people say , oh , is n ' t it fun to see someone like that have a big , big problem ?
reporter : a perfection ##ism reflected in even the smallest details of stewart ' s life .
martha does n ' t like to talk about how unpleasant things have been , but you can get signals of it in surprising ways .
when we sat down to lunch , she had put out these beautiful chop sticks which i commented orion .
she said , in china , the person with the thin ##nes ##t chop sticks has the highest social status .
and of course , i had to get the thin ##nes ##t chop sticks .
then she paused and said , that ' s why people hate me .
reporter : love her or hate her , martha stewart has tied every aspect of her image to her business .
even her daily calendar turned into a marketing tool .
she said to me once that my life is " the truman show " and meant i ' m always on .
from the time i get up until i go to bed , the whole world is watching .
hello , everyone .

good to be [ b ##lee ##p ] king .
reporter : with the success of a new television show and last year ' s oz - fest tour ready to kick off , things were looking great for oz ##zy os ##bourne .
he was sober .
he was rich and surrounded by a family who loved him but once again , oz ##zy ' s high would hit a low .
that july , sharon os ##bourne , oz ##zy ' s long time manager , wife and best friend , announced to the world that she ' d been diagnosed with colon cancer .
every fiber of oz ##zy was shaken .
he had to be se ##date ##d for a while .
reporter : sharon would have to undergo rounds of chemotherapy all summer .
oz ##zy took time off from oz - fest to tend to his wife .
ever the rock , sharon faced cancer head on .
when you go in there and people so much worse than me , and it ' s like , how lucky am i have a great support system .
reporter : even with sharon trying to make things as easy as possible on her husband , he was still a mess .
his struggle with sob ##riety would be tested again .
oz ##zy ' s not doing too good right now .
drinking ?
drinking and he ' s very delicate .
he ' s , like , dealing with it the best he can .
reporter : despite sharon ' s illness , it ' s business as usual for the family , though pushed back , filming commenced last fall on a second season of " the os ##bourne ##s . "
some days when i ' m feeling bad , i say i ca n ' t do this anymore , and then you wake up and see the crew , and then , you know , you snap out of it .
reporter : the larger question loomed .
how could comedy come out of chemotherapy treatments ?
sharon is dealing with the diagnosis and illness but what ' s interesting is humor is the same .
reporter : and the humor did remain the same .
the show came back with a vengeance last fall chronic ##ling oz ##zy and sharon dealing with cancer and the kids hoping - - coping with new - found celebrity and one of the top rated shows , ratings for the second season slid .
i ' m not banking my whole life on bringing , you know , number one rated show .
having a nervous break down .
the bubble will burst .
reporter : this year , more ups and downs .
sharon announced in april that the cancer was in re ##mission .
but just weeks after that announcement , son jack entered drug and alcohol rehabilitation in california .
his family said that his party life style caught up with him .
now , with a third season set to start , will oz ##zy ' s role as a family man change the image in the ann ##uls of heavy metal mad man ?
i think oz ##zy ' s the guy that hit a head of a bat .
you know ? crazy , drug taking , hard drinking , hard living rock n roller .
i think what the show does is also show that you might be those things , but also might be a pretty great dad , too .
i would n ' t be here now if it was n ' t for my wife .
i always loved my wife but sometimes i do n ' t like her and sometimes she does n ' t like me but we love each other .
i hate these people that go , we ' ve been married for 56 years and never had a bad word .
they must have been living in a different planet .
reporter : oz ##zy os ##bourne ' s life filled with incredible highs crashing into devastating low ##s .
a mani ##c life , grounded in family values .
oz ##zy ' s not going to like me saying this , but he ' s a very tender , gentle man .
this is a guy whose world revolves not so much around music as around his wife .
rock ' n roll !
part of the legacy of oz ##zy os ##bourne is a caution ##ary tale . it ' s also , you know , tale that includes family love , you know , and a lot of good things .
we have had it .
reporter : it ' s a tale that continues to un ##fold .
no telling how long the os ##bourne phenomenon may last but the family ' s loyal following will always be screaming for more .
stop screaming !
reporter : and so will oz ##zy .
sharon !

welcome back to " people in the news .
"
the int ##if ##ada , the spontaneous 1987 palestinian uprising against the israeli occupation , herald ##ed the rise of the muslim fundamental ##ism .
in what had been a mostly secular palestinian movement .
the most popular of these groups hamas , an acronym for islamic resistance movement .
in english it means ze ##al , its aim - - the destruction of israel .
hamas is an islamic movement .
at the very beginning , it was encouraged by israel because they thought it was a counter weight to palestinian nationalism which is , of course , a secular movement .
hamas was founded in 1988 by a blind para ##ple ##gic cleric who was influenced by the islamic muslim brotherhood , with backing from israel , he set up sha ##rit ##ies in the improve ##rish ##ed strip in the 1970s .
slowly it became more and more pol ##itic ##ized , and more and more extreme in its demands for an islamic state .
the ex ##tre ##mism took the form of suicide bombings and terrorist attacks . but hamas had already become an important part of palestinian society through its charity work and its influence increased over time by providing community services when the palestinian authority did not .
hamas plays on the palestinian authority ' s failure to produce .
its basic message , the palestinian authority is corrupt , it fails to deliver , hamas is not corrupt .
hamas cares about the person on the street and it does deliver .
unfortunately , those same charitable organizations , those same charity committees that funnel the funds to need ##ier palestinians , also serve to support terrorist attacks .
israel and the united states say ara ##fat has not been tough enough on terrorism , and have attempted to force him out of the current peace process .
the prime minister known as abu maze ##n must now contend with the rejection of side by side palestinian and israeli states .
a cornerstone of the new peace plan .
he ' s trying to get hamas to co - exist with israel .
conservative israelis are skeptical .
he is not working against hamas , he is working in tandem .
he is negotiating with them .
he is not telling them to di ##sb ##and and regulate their weapons , so i have no faith in the ability of abu maze ##n to put terror aside .
reporter : settlers call the just concluded israeli - american - palestinian summit a surrender , and were not impressed .
translator : the armed int ##if ##ada must end and we must use and resort to peaceful means in our quest to end the occupation and the suffering of the palestinians , and the israelis , and to establish the palestinian state .
hamas and other palestinian militant group rejected abbas ' call to end their attacks with a deadly raid on an israeli army outpost in gaza .
we are all saying that the resistance will continue despite the summit in a ##qa ##ba .
israel re ##tal ##iated on hamas , namely al - ran ##tis ##si , it missed him and killed civilians .
translator : hamas will not drop our weapons , even if all leaders are assassinated .
reporter : since the second int ##if ##ada began in 2000 , over 700 israelis have been killed , during the same time there have been more than 2 , 000 palestinian deaths according to the red crescent .
including hamas leaders targeted for assassination .
if you want an end to terrorism , if you want an end to violence , you have to give people hope and you have to give them a stake in the political process .
i think that hamas is ready to join the political process , however , if the only price for the political price is you must fight hamas , if that ' s what they are requiring abu maze ##n to do , they are almost man ##dating that he will fail .
the main test of mahmoud abbas , will be to establish an overall command of all armed groups , if not , it does n ' t have a chance .
you know , leaders have to do things

it ' s come to stealing children ##s books , is it ?
i think these are profitable children ##s book .
so very popular .
i think that people think they probably are lucrative for them .
as you mentioned , if anyone is seen to be selling these on the black market they will be prosecuted .
is that why you think they were stolen , sale before the deadline or after ?
i think probably they know they can make more money before the deadline on these books .
but i know no rep ##utable book shop will take these stolen goods and sell them .
i think we are looking at in market stores and sales over the next coming days .
we have police officers looking for them and will prose ##cute anyone seen selling them or buying them .
considering how much publicity was circulating about this book , there is injunction ##s about publishing anything or talking about the plot . what kind of security was there in place for any truck carrying books ?
the books were stolen from a warehouse , they have their own security measures .
they did have their cc ##p ##b operational , we are looking at that to see if

seven minutes before the top of the hour .
at the beginning we told but this incredible story about the rescue of three fishermen in the waters off the coast of vancouver , stuck in the waters , gail force winds , small boat , they were rescued by a cruise ship that happened to be in the neighborhood .
those three men did n ' t realize how lucky they were until they were plucked out of the water .
we have with us captain kent ring ##board , on board the royal caribbean " ra ##dian ##ce of the seas .
" i understand you were on board when this rescue happened .
were you in charge ?
yes , that ' s correct i was in charge .
tell us about what happened here .
what was it you were looking at when you looked out over the waters ?
well , it was quite windy , gust ##y winds up to 40 , 50 miles an hour .
and it came from southeast .
and we got the alarm this distress situation just before 5 : 00 in the morning .
and we were on relatively slow speed for the time being , but we of course , speed ##ed up to the position , which was given , and we - - after an hour , we spotted the fishing boat in the waters .
these men were in some water that was quite fr ##ig ##id .
if they stayed out there for long they could have suffered severe tragedy , perhaps .
i want to ask you , have you ever done anything like this ?
have you ever seen anything like this done ?
no , i have never seen this type of operation where you have a fishing vessel disappear , more or less .
and that the survivors , they had to go into the water , pick them up from the water .
was there any point at which you did n ' t think you would be able to pull it off ?
sorry , please say again ?
was there any point at which you thought you would n ' t be able to pull it off ?
no , absolutely not .
we - - we were 100 % sure we could make it , absolutely .
because we came very close to the vessel . we had our rescue boat out soon .
so i felt confident about it .
i saw the fishermen also had the surviving suits on .
so that gave me more time to help .
that was a good thing for them .
what about your crew that was actually involved in the rescue here ?
are they trained for this sort of thing ?
yes , they are very much well - trained .
we train for this type of operation at least every 14 days .
i ' m hopeful those three fishermen bought you a glass of wine once you got them on board .
we gave them some .
these incredible pictures .
i ' m not sure if you have been able to see some of these pictures playing on the television sets around the world but we look at these pictures and think there ' s no way a cruise ship , as big as it is , will be able to maneuver into position in these kinds of heavy seas to save three cork ##s out there on the water .
amazing .
it was interesting .
but we had a good maneuver ##ing capability on

the people that gave birth to you are not necessarily your mom and dad .
they ' re the ones that love you and care for you .

reporter : finally , it ' s time to go .
with the 16 - hour flight to look forward to - -
it ' s been a total roller ##co ##aster .
reporter : - - the kramer ##s are finally on their way .
with our video camera , they record their journey .
we just boarded the plane .
the flight attendants are wearing masks .
reporter : the kramer ##s decide not to .
neither do the other 23 adoptive families on the long overseas trip .
we just got off , so our 16 - hour flight is over .
reporter : the families begin with a tour .
an alligator .
my goodness .
reporter : the kramer ##s must wait and travel to another town for abby . on the next flight , passengers wear masks and their temperatures are taken for signs of sar ##s .

hi , there .
i kind of leaned over and gave her a kiss on the forehead and she looked up and - -
reporter : they know little about their little girl , found by the side of the road days after she was born .
she spent most of her life in an orphan ##nage .
now abby has a new life in california with the kramer ##s and their two kids .
i think i love her more every day , every time i look at her .
reporter : the ##lma gutierrez , cnn , los angeles .
well , it is our turn to meet the kramer ##s back in the u . s . after their journey to china to bring home the newest and cute ##st perhaps , member of their family , in los angeles , the proud parents of 11 mn ##th abigail kramer .
thank you for being with us .
thank you for having us .
she is un ##bel ##ie ##va ##bly adorable .
thanks .
tell us a little about this journey , that moment when you first saw her .
you traveled .
this is going on two years , you battled bureaucracy , traveling thousands of miles , facing disease .
what was that like ?
incredible .
you know , just to hold her in our arms , have her with us . i mean , you count the moments .
and it was just anticipation all the way there .
so it was relief .
it was , you know , a dream come true .
she was - - she ' s really a delight .
i mean , though it was a little pan ##de ##monium at the moment , she ' s wonderful .
we love her . and , mark , it was - - the first time you were holding her , it looked like she was crying a lot .
she seemed startled to see someone that looked so different .
yes , this was probably her first experience ever seeing a fair - skinned , bearded goat ##ee , monster looking guy and she just freaked out the first time she saw me .
it took about a day and a half for her to warm up .
i had to hide in the hotel room .
she would find me in the room and start crying every time she saw me .
you had to hide in the hotel room ?
yeah , she ' d find me across the room and break into tears .
it was kind of that way with anyone that was blond , that was fair - skinned .
yeah .
when you first heard about sar ##s , i mean , did you suddenly think , this may not happen ?
this could stop the whole thing
sure .
we got calls that morning saying " did you hear that they ' re halt ##ing all travel ? " and we put in a call to the agency .
we were going .
and we put a lot of trust in our agency .
and they were great . you know , unless we were absolutely stopped , we were going .
right .
after two years of working towards it , we were almost more afraid not to go than to go at the very end .
you know , mark , i hope this is n ' t too personal a question .
if it is , just simply tell me to shut up .
but when - - in the story i saw abby was abandoned on the side of the road , which is just - - it ' s un ##thi ##nka ##ble .
you ca n ' t even imagine a parent doing that .
what do you think you ' re going to tell her when she grows up about how she came to live with you ?
well , i get emotional every time i - - someone asks that .
but we ' re going to give her the best love and affection we can and give her a strong self esteem and we ' re going to teach her

well , sex abuse by priests remains an issue in the catholic church in the united states and it is certain to be an issue as bishops gather tomorrow in st . louis for their semi ##ann ##ual meeting .
under a charter approved last year by the national conference of catholic bishops , diocese officials will report allegations of sexual abuse of a minor to public authorities .
past , present or future sexual abuse of a minor will lead to removal from the ministry .
no priest or deacon ##s who sexually abuse a minor may be transferred to another des ##ies .
with me now to talk more about the o ' brien case and the divisions still dividing the church are barbara b ##lain , the founder of the survivors network in st . louis and also joining us from detroit joe mayor , the founder of a priest support group .

as the bishops get ready for this important meeting tomorrow , are you satisfied that they have taken all the appropriate steps to deal with the abuse issue ?

a net worth of $ 300 million .
anyone who knows me knows my obsession with t ##wee ##n stars .
they ' re kids eight to 14 , and for millions , their heroes are barely occupy pub ##erty .
the reason for my obsession is simple , deep see ##thing jealousy . it is n ' t enough for these t ##wee ##n stars to be on the tv or movie .
they want to own every form of media and want to own it now .
unlike the corey feldman of the ' 80s , today ' s t ##wee ##ns are n ' t content with succeeding in just one of medium .
mary indicate and ashley olsen started it all .
now they have a billion dollar empire built on videos , clothing perfume and more .
and then there ' s the t ##wee ##n hilary duff , fans know her as lizzie mag wire .
movies , books , albums . three corporate giants head the way .
typical , nickelodeon or disney starts them off .
then when they ' re ready to breed they go to the wb .
why such a focus on these t ##wee ##n stars ? it has little to do with their artistic vision .
one star told vanity fair their favorite author is whoever wrote the bible .
these kids are at that magical age when new multi ##bill ##ion declare spending power is put in service of intense peer pressure leading to brand loyal ##ties that can last a lifetime .
the flip side between stars , though , is once the fans grow up their star power may dim .
do n ' t believe in just ask one of the corey ##s .
these t ##wee ##ns are everywhere .
they ' re right on the cover of vanity fair . t ##wee ##ns are all over it .
that ' s the issue right there .
so we have with us vanity fair fashion director elizabeth olsen . i was shocked when i saw them covers the t ##wee ##ns .
why are they so important ?
they ' re important because we report on what ' s happening .
we report on the culture of what ' s now , what maze money , what the buzz is , what ' s next . and they ' re making a lot of money .
a much more than a lot of money .
unlike stars of the past , they really are not content to be singers or dancers , they are like om ##ni ##media , mini martha stewart .
they ' re more than that , actually , because they have a television show to back themselves up , then the movie , then the clothing line .
they have much more and reach a much broader audience as well .
i saw one interviewed , and they said , yeah , when i left the co ##sby show at age four , i cut an album at age five .
what happened happened to being kids ?
that was the great thing about the photo shoot .
thee still young , ambitious , excited , they play dress ##up and have pillow fights .
who ' s the ultimate t ##wee ##n ?
i would have i to say you have to talk about hilary duff , and you have to talk about the olsen twins .
because the olsen twins started it all .
they created it , maybe .
they more than started it . and they started pre ##nat ##al . but they turned it into an empire , what shirley temple could have done .
had she only known .
i think their company is called dual star , like a gross of a billion dollars last year .
they work hard .
they ' re not just sitting there hiring people to do their business .
they do their own business , and they ' re well - rounded and polite people .
are they nice ?
they ' re so nice and cool .
how about that ?
they ' re actually very , very cool .
i ' m not sure of that . and hilary duff is a star , and i guarantee you , they will grace their own cover .
do they all have staying power ?
one ca n ' t predict that all have it , but some have it .
it depends on who ' s managing it , what career choices they make , what their parents help them to do .
it would be interesting to see the audience that sort of ad ##ores them now , whether

senior israeli officials telling cnn that the size of the area to be returned to the gaza strip is not so much the question confirming that , in fact , returning all of the gaza strip to palestinian security control is one of the options the israelis have indeed put on the table , the issue is the palestinian readiness and willingness to be able to implement full security control throughout all of the gaza strip .

the nasa and the european space agency both launch missions to mars this month sending rovers and ash ##ters to probe the red planet .
one of the big questions about mars is when or whether humans will ever be able to visit .
it ' s an idea plagued with un ##sol ##ved problems .
the latest issue of " popular science magazine " takes a look at the challenges nasa is facing .
joining us is the contributing editor .
good to see you , jeff .
thank you .
it was only about 30 years ago when we went to the moon .
so what ' s the difficulty in being able to go to mars ?
it ' s un ##ima ##gina ##bly difficult and different .
mars is at most times 100 million miles away from us .
it ' s a nine - month trip .
then if we stay there for about a year or two , the whole trip could last about three years .
we ' re talking about conditions where there ' s radiation in space cosmic radiation that could cause cancer .
the communications conditions once you ' re on mars , just to talk to people on earth , there ' s a 20 minute delay in the conversation .
so the - - you know , the issues are so much larger than going to the moon . and for now , it ' s 250 days , which seems to be the maximum for astronauts in space anyway .
but as you say , it ' s a much further travel .
but let ' s talk about some of the hurdles that ham ##per humans to be able to survive there .
the dust , for one thing .
cat ##ara ##cts another .
let ' s talk about the right kind of spacecraft that would be able to allow humans to actually get that far and to survive .
right .
well , first of all , the spacecraft would not be launched from earth .
you ' d have to launch is from in space already , which means we would have to build it in space .
so that means we need a good shuttle that ' s going to take us back and forth to build the spacecraft .
then we have to come up with the fuel that will take it out of the earth ' s orbit all the way to mars .
that ' s probably going to be nuclear propulsion at this point again something we have n ' t really developed yet , because we could n ' t carry that much fuel , obviously .
liquid oxygen would be way too heavy to carry all the way to mars .
the bigger issue is once we get there , we ca n ' t carry oxygen or water or food to stay there three years , so we ' re going to have to do all of that on the surface of the planet . and think of it .
mars is carbon dioxide .
so we ca n ' t breathe there .
so we ' re going to have to come up with some conversion technique to create water , to create oxygen and then some way of growing food on the planet itself .
all of this is in the works now , but i think it ' s going to take quite a few years to develop it .
you talk about the cosmic radiation .
then of course there is the zero g bone loss , almost like the er ##od ##ing of bone to humans that would be at risk as well .
absolutely .
there could be as much as 50 % bone loss in astronauts in mars .
why ?
during the time in mars .
because when the body has - - when there is no d ##pr ##avi ##ty as there is on mars , the body does n ' t pick up the calcium in the bones , so it does n ' t keep getting the bones stronger and stronger .
so they will just lose it .
they will be almost like old people even at the age of 40 .

an occasion that marked the formal establishment between our two countries .
since then this relationship has grown in importance to us both through good times and bad .
both of my generation and britain have special pause to remember the unacceptable sacrifice the russian people made to defeat fascism in the second world war .
nothing , not even the fact that our countries became estranged in the war ' s aftermath , has ever dim ##med our memory of the scale of your loss .
that experience should continue to inspire us , as we seek to build a more peaceful and secure world .
when i visited your country in 1994 , i recall saying to president ye ##lts ##in that he and i spent most of our lives believing such a visit would never happen .
and that i hoped he was as delighted as i was to be proved wrong .
i ' m just as delighted now , nine years later , to be able to welcome you here and to learn about the great changes which have occurred in your country since i was there .
russia has established itself as our partner and our friend .
we work together bi ##lat ##ari ##ly and on the international stage .
and we are developing new links all the time in fields of commerce , culture , counter ##ter ##ror ##ism , energy , education environment .
i know you will be seeing evidence of some of this during your visit .
mr . president , it is , i believe , a sign of genuine friendship that we are able to have disagreements , but remain firm partners .
it is no secret that the significant differences between our two countries earlier this year on how best to handle iraq .
but we are now able to look forward together firmly in agreement on the route we have decided in the united nations .
although , the tragic loss of british lives today reminds us all of the difficulties to be faced .
but as we look ahead , we know that our long - term partnership is of profound importance to both of us .
this is clearly evident , if we look beyond the challenges of international politics . in the last few months alone , we have heard the announcements of major investments in russia by british companies .
we have also heard a different sign of sir paul mccartney playing to enthusiastic crowds in red square .
and we , in turn , have been en ##th ##ral ##led by the celebrations of your own city in petersburg .
at the same time , work continues to bring the young people of our countries closer together through language , teaching , school exchanges and university programs .
we have a vibrant and exciting relationship from which we both derive mass benefit .

comes with someone involved in case of a 22 - year - old disabled woman in florida .
they talk about her current pre ##dic ##ament .
a mind of todd ##ler .
raped while in state care , pregnant . and forced in the spotlight when je ##b bush tried to get a guardian appointed for her fe ##tus .
pre ##dic ##ament goes hard enough to describe that .
to continue a pregnancy that her lawyer says she is not aware of but the decision was n ' t based on the advice of the governor .
here ' s cnn ' s susan candy ##iot ##i .
reporter : we know her only by her initial , this mother to be , jd ##s .
only 22 years old with no known family .
police say she has the mental capacity a 1 - year - old .
according to court filing , jd ##s has cerebral pal ##sy and she ' s au ##tist ##ic . she did n ' t become pregnant by choice , she was raped , police say in a group home overseen by the state of florida .
jd ##s is now more than six months pregnant .
since she ' s incapable of make her own decision , a florida judge based his decision on below to give birth on the recommendation .
two doctor agreed jd ##s is , " in good health , " two son ##o grams reveal , no obvious or significant fetal abnormalities . although , jd ##s is au ##tist ##ic , a guardian says jd ##s appears to be responsive north just setting in a semi ##con ##sc ##ious state all the time .
still und ##ec ##ided , an appeal by governor je ##b bush , who wants the guardian ap ##oint ##ed for the fe ##tus .
he says the un ##born child must be protected .
however , a spokesman for the governor says he calls the court ruling for jd ##s , not to ab ##ort the baby , compassionate and humane . last month in miami , a judge ordered an abortion for another severely disabled raped woman who had been living this a state - regulated home .
in that case , the young woman ' s mother approved the abortion . and in this case , there are a lot of una ##ns ##wer ##ed questions still .
for example , what will happen to the baby , and what will happen to jd ##s ?
of course , according to the guardian , she ' s very worried about that , too , and she has warned the court that she hopes the mother will be placed in a better home when all of this is over , one where she is far better protected than she was by the state in a home where police say she was raped .
aaron ?
well , two questions .
do they know who the rap ##ist is ?
that ' s sort a yes or no , i suppose .
and the other is , has the state done anything ?
is it doing anything to tighten up security in these places with respect defense ##less people are being attacked ?
reporter : well , first of all , regarding the rape , they hope to find out who the father is once she gives birth because they will analyze dna from the baby in order to try to determine pat ##ern ##ity in this case .
and the governor has ordered a panel of experts now to study this issue of security , far better security than is clearly needed for people such as this woman , jd ##s , living in group homes .
well , we will wait for the report .
thank you , susan .

b you ' re obviously a qu - - - a pretty politically sa ##v ##vy kind of guy , are n ' t you ?
a well , i was the one , who just happened to go home back in like nineteen eighty or something and saw bill clinton
b oh , yeah ?
a on on television .
he - - we ha - - - i came from a small town in tennessee called paris , and there ' s two stations we can pick up , one
b okay .
a from jackson , a little town , and the other was from nashville , a big town .
so we got most of our ~ tv from jackson , so i was flipping through the channels , and i saw this little guy , uh the governor of arkansas giving a speech .
b yep .
a i said , that guy could be president .
b is that right ?
a i only heard about - - two minutes of him speaking .
you know , he was art ##iculate , he was charming , he was young .
and i said , that guy could be president .
b yep .
yep .
a and um so then when i heard he was running , those four years later - - uh , eight years later , whatever it was .
because it was a long time later .
b sure .
a i saw him , and i was telling all my friends , oh , vote for vote for this guy , bill clinton , vote for him .
they were saying , oh no , no , that old country - - dump .
he do n ' t know nothing .
i said , he ' s a rhodes scholar , he ' s smart .
he ' s and he ' s funny and he ' s good .
oh no , no , he ' s too young , and he came from that little , little pod ##unk - - g - uh state he never did anything .
i said , he ' s going to be president .
i was telling all my friends .
i said , you know , and i was before - - they said , well , i thought you supported george bush , and i said , well i did support george bush , but he does n ' t know what he ' s doing and he needs to go .
and uh so i says vote for him , vote for him , vote for him , you know .
and they voted for jerry brown and all these crazy people .
b yeah , that ' s right .
oh , is that right ?
a and i says , you ' re just wasting your vote , why are you doing that ?
he needs your help .
so i went and volunteered for him and everything , and - - and i met hillary , and and tip ##per and al , and and i almost got to meet him .
b oh , is that right ?
really ?
a uh - huh .
i worked at the democrats convention and everything .
uh - huh , yeah .
b very cool , very cool .
a and uh it was great , i had a good time , and they
b what great experience .
a yeah , and they fed us , and had a party for us , all that kind of stuff , you know .
so it was fun .
but it worked out .
but i think we they better go back to a governor from like uh
b well , sure .
a uh north carolina , or like the one from kansas .
she ' s very tall , she reminds you of uh christie whitman , the governor of new jersey , remember her ?
b yep .
okay ?
a she ' s tall , kind of - - mm bush - - butch .
ac - kind of .
she ' s uh you know , like she played basketball or something like that .
real smart , quiet - spoke ##d but stern , you know .
b yeah , not not real feminine , yeah .
eh sure .
a and so i - - she she can give that demeanor that people like in leaders , of being the big
b well , people want to feel secure , right ?
and who ' s in that position ? they want to feel that they ' re trust ##worthy and honorable , and i think , you know
a yeah .
yeah , but
b clinton did so many fantastic things during his term in office , but he shot himself on the foot with all of his personal garbage , you know , and i think that overshadowed how brilliant he was as president .
a yeah .

bill but
alexander the atmosphere of , you know , how things are done , who ' s in command and how , you know , decisions are made , and
bill right .
and they also did say that , uh , previous work places , too , so
alexander yeah .
okay , w ##h - uh i i
bill i can talk about that .
where w ##h -
alexander go a - go ahead , you can talk about your previous work place .
bill yeah , w ##h - - - yeah , i was going to ask you where you work , too .
alexander i work with a pharmaceutical company .
i we - - have a little over three hundred and some ( ( million ) ) employees .
bill oh wow .
and what do you do there ?
alexander you know .
i work as a patient care advocate .
and i - - i work as an on ##li - i do online , you know , online , uh , pharmaceutical company - - where i have - - filled and - - ref ##ille ##d take orders sent back to us online .
bill oh , okay .
that ' s interesting .
alexander and , you know , and i have a company , as well , set up .
i think we have the account manager , and we have - - the vice president .
we have super - team lead - team leads , uh i and then have operations specialist .
we have , you know , i - - team managers , training managers .
it ' s a very big company .
yeah , and i think that the atmosphere is very good , i
bill right .
alexander yeah .
bill well , i think that ' s important to to have a good atmosphere and also , uh , uh , i - know who who really is in charge , uh , you know , and and know who you have to answer to .
because sometimes , y - i i i did i years ago i had a company that was , uh , it was , uh , i was a sub ##s - s - captive sub - contractor for making packaging material .
and , um , there were a lot of sales ##men in the company , they had a tendency to , you know , there was there was , uh , a chain of command , you might say .
you know , there was , uh , the person that was the , uh , head of the organization .
but , all the sales ##men - - used to come around and give orders , too , you know .
so it made it kind of difficult for the m - for my employees , because they would the sales ##men would be coming out , uh , uh , without consulting with the one that was in charge .
they would just be coming out and giving orders when they should already went through him .
so it made it difficult .
so i i i think it ' s really important to h - have that really clear .
that that there ' s some organized way to deal with , uh , problems and orders and things like that , and if there is a problem , then - - you go to the person who ' s in charge and - - then they can handle it .
so , that was - - that that ' s just a you know , a - - previous , uh , type of work that i had .
and i and tha - i think that ' s what they wanted us to talk about , too , right ?
alexander yeah .
yeah , that ' s that ' s that ' s i think it ' s just basically , is ( ( ) ) one of the things i perceive is if - what kind of , you know , environment is it , and is it inviting is it , you know , all that they i guess that ' s what they ' re aiming at .
you know , it ' s not a place where everybody trying to give instruction and everybody trying to do , you know .
uh , but i for my job is i - i - - - we have us a very diverse feel . we have a lot of people who are from different country , and , you know , and - - i think they are pretty much accepting , and i , you know , i - bas - basically you - you can promote yourself if you do a good job , i mean , they do n ' t pick and choose , you know .
bill right .
alexander it ' s a very - - environment that allows you to grow in .
and i think they thinks i rightful ##ly do n ' t , if - - like if i have a problem , like , i ' ll freshly go to my team lead or the supervisor and she takes it to her boss , and , you know , the boss takes it to the next level and , you know , something like that .
bill right .
yeah , but that - - i feel like that that ' s very important .
uh , for a company to be well - run , it has to have , uh , a c - it ' s t - has to be able to send a clear message - - as to how to handle problems and who who is the one that ' s uh , uh , indicated for - - for those problems - - to handle .
and and people - - those in the company need to be um instructed - - to know w ##h - where their relative place is in the company . so that they they do n ' t overs ##te ##p their bounds .
alexander yeah .
bill because when that happens , and it that makes , uh , that creates problems for the employees .
it makes them discontent .
i mean , if they if they can be , eh , um , you know , jumped on ar ##bit ##rar ##ily by just about anybody , then pretty soon , you know , they ' re they ' re they ' re not going to be content at all , they ' re just going to wonder , well when when ' s the next hit going to come , you know .
when ' s somebody else going to jump on me ?

bush cabinet president bush has just been elected to another term in office , and he has already started to appoint new people to his political cabinet as current members like colin powell and john ash ##croft resign .
who would you like to see appointed to his cabinet next term ?
who are they , and why do you think they should be appointed ?
if you were president , which national figures would you appoint to your cabinet and why ?
what new cabinet positions would you create and who would fill them ?
a i i ' m sorry to see colin powell leave , leaving .
i think he ' s probably one of the most - - diplomatic - - um , men that i ' ve seen in politics .
b so do i .
a he he ' s very honest , he ' s very strong in his beliefs , and i ' m sorry to see him go .
i ' m also sorry to see tom ridge resigning .
um
b i am too , and you know what , i do n ' t where , do you know anything about his background ?
i do n ' t know where he came from .
a he ' s the governor of , he was the governor of pennsylvania .
b oh , that ' s right .
okay .
a and um after uh
b now i remember .
a he before nine eleven , he was - - he was on an advisory commit ##tal - - committee - - to the gov ##er - to the president i guess , besides him running uh pennsylvania , and then after nine eleven they appointed him you know , head of homeland security , and then created the
b uh - huh .
a uh secretary ' s position for him , or for someone , but him being the person at that time .
i just think that
b yeah .
yeah .
a it ' s so soon - - since nine eleven , and he has been creating his own job , i - in essence , because it ' s such a new position .
but , i think it ' s - - it would ' ve been - - better to have one person - - like continuing that .
however ,
b i do too .
i i do too .
i hate to i hate to change - - change horses there so quickly .
a yeah .
b uh i i i ' d that - - that - - job uh uh needs continuity - - for a while . any ##how .
you know , i m - i mean , at least until they get
a yeah .
b settled on what the job really is .
a yeah , well uh maybe maybe on one hand - - somebody new will bring a new perspective to it , which would - - be helpful , but i still think that
b uh yeah
a the people that are up for it - - there ' s some p -
b yeah , but if it ' s if the perspective is too new , you know , that ' s not going to be a good thing , because uh wholesale changes is not what they need to do .
a yeah .
yeah .
b uh uh no matter who takes it over .
they need to they need to - - think long and hard before they start making changes .
because if they make one wrong one , you know , it
a but there are there are a couple women up for - - the position as well as um you know , a few men that are up for the position .
and i do n ' t know anything about the women that are up for the position .
um - - one - - two of the men are from new york , one is a head of - - the the - - who was there at nine eleven .
he was the chief of police .
or the commissioner - - of of police i guess .
uh who was with gi ##ulia ##ni throughout the whole thing .
b uh - huh .
a um they ' re also thinking about gi ##ulia ##ni , so - - i mean , i think they have some qualified candidates .
b yeah .
a however , i think - - with it ' s homeland security , which means it ca n ' t just be new york , which is where of course , their focus is going to be .
b sure .
a having - - you know , been there , and through that .
so , as long as they do n ' t have blind ##ers on , you know , i would be okay with that , but they ' ve got to look , obviously - - at ports - - nuclear power plants , you know , and ot ##h - other areas where we are vulnerable .
b yeah .
yeah , and you know what ' s really scary to me ?
i i do n ' t i ' ve never seen it mentioned , i ' ve never - - but - - but if they really wanted to to i do n ' t know uh uh uh if they if they really wanted to put - - fear in the american people , uh - - i know it would work with me , is if they say just uh if if - - i say they , bin laden , or who whoever - - uh - - uh is running that team now , uh were to - - were to just pick a small - - mid - american town ,
a m ##hm .
b uh and just wipe it out ,
a yeah , no , and i i th ##i - i think that ' s a great fear .
b you know , and there are a lot of ways - - there are a lot of ways to do that .
i mean , i mean , it would n ' t take a nuclear weapon .
a no , no .
b uh uh and it it could be done so easily because i - i - most small towns are protected by a small town police force .
a m ##hm .
b you know ?
and that ' s it .
a well , i think that - - there ' s - - really - - been a strengthening , and i hope they can - - get it together without this .
part of the problem with that is the ~ cia and the ~ fbi and who ' s going to be in charge because they want to create this new position .
b ( ( i ) ) no , they ' ve always
a and , so nobody wants to - - give up - - power
b yeah .
a and , you know , you - - in this case , and and going forward , we have to put the good of - - the country - - and the good of the world .

eh uh i - - i heard uh that colin powell wanted um - - to resign last year and they talked him out of it .
ron uh - huh , uh - huh .
she ##rri or something like that and uh so - - i was still surprised this year when

she ##rri i was n ' t like it and then tom ridge yesterday .
ron yeah , i saw that .
yeah , i i uh that one i think one probably was the one that most surprised me .
i had n ' t i had n ' t really thought about it . i - - colin powell did n ' t surprise me .
ash ##croft surprised me a little bit um but um i sort of started to think he might step down because evidently he was being he was considered somewhat of a lightning rod for um you know some of his more controversial stands and stuff so .
she ##rri uh - huh .
ron but and and so have you been following the uh the proposed nominees ?
i mean do you think
she ##rri kellogg , the kellogg guy .
ron oh yeah , that ' s right .
where ' s he going to commerce ?
is that where he ' s headed ?
she ##rri yeah , that ' s it , huh ?
ron yeah , i do n ' t know anything about him .
i i do n ' t know .
do you know anything about him ?
she ##rri mm .
well , all i know is that that ' s like a real prestigious uh position , you know to be the what the ~ ceo of kellogg ?
ron yeah , yeah .
i guess it sort of concerns me that uh you know we ' re looking at yet uh another corporate head coming into the government .
i
she ##rri mm .
ye - ye - you know , this is like a - - uh it ' s a re - - - i think we have a real problem .
that is uh - - you know almost like a big beast you know that ' s right there and we do n ' t even identify it
ron uh - huh .
uh - huh , uh - huh .
she ##rri way way way more than we realize .
ron yeah , i i think you ' re probably right and i think it - - maybe even particularly true under this president , although i do n ' t think it ' s just limited to him .
i think it ' s a common problem in the ~ us .
she ##rri i f - - - i uh i think i - i - it ' s uh more evident now than ever .
ron uh - huh , uh - huh
she ##rri you know , really um - - tre ##men - tremendous ##ly a ruling and reigning .
ron did you um
she ##rri i think it it ' s a global uh has a global effect .
ron yeah .
she ##rri i think that ' s why al - qaeda - - took down the the uh twin towers .
eh w - they were making a a statement .
uh i think something like that possibly , that it had to do with corporate america .
ron uh - huh , you mean about the corporate thing ?
she ##rri hm ?
ron uh you mean because of its - - what it represented around corporate america or something ?
is that what you think .

ron do you suppose ?
uh - huh .
she ##rri but uh i do n ' t know you ' ll probably really laugh but i do n ' t know , i i i always thought that - - ralph nad ##er was kind of a a character
ron oh .
uh - huh .
she ##rri but what i really i mean i really listened to what he said when he was being interviewed
ron m ##hm .
she ##rri and in just a few words , he did n ' t min ##ce any meat or anything , in a few words he said so much that was so

she ##rri like - - like a cl ##arion call it rang so clear .
you could hear what he was saying and it was really making sense , and i think he ' s an expert
ron so who would y - what would you appoint him to ?

a and the one that , oh what ' s the - - the guy that , um - - tom ridge just re - resigned yesterday .
he was another one that was - - i did n ' t really know that much about him .
i mean , i guess he was kind of the first - - one on that homeland security or , in charge of that .
but i heard that they were going to - - one of the possible candidates is the the guy he used to be the chief of police of new york .
well that ' s somebody to me that ' s going to have some good - - insight into , you know , what it takes you know - - to - - keep a city secure .
you know , because new york , i do n ' t know if you ' ve ever been there
b yeah , i went there ( ( before ) )
a has has has got some - - different rules from texas as far as - - you know you know , running the city .
i mean i , there ' s a lot lot more people dense population up there than there is in in texas and they probably would have uh the pol - uh the police chief would probably know - - well what can work in like , airports or , you know , things , situations like that .
he was , he was a pretty good - - pretty smart person .
but i , it did n ' t - - i ca n ' t remember his name , but - - the , i saw an interview with him , and - - how he , uh - - ran new york and uh - - you know , some of the - - ru - you know , they changed some of the rules , uh - - uh , not rules , but the way they - - uh
b the management team
a protected the city .
the the police kind of changed their tactics and , because there was a lot of - - oh - - run down areas , and a lot of crime and they , you know - - got - - cleaned it up , and and - - they passed some laws that said , you know , you could n ' t , i think it was like , um - - you know , like homeless people that - - carrying - - uh - - you know , shopping carts , or something like that , and it sounds - - small - - to outlaw that .
but they outlawed that because they said a lot of people were stealing stuff . they ' d stick them in the shopping carts and push them down the road . you would n ' t know , oh , they ' re just a homeless person .
well they cut that out and they found out - - it cut down on the theft .
uh - - i guess people - - hide them in their basket and - - or taking something and then stick in their basket and the police never - - you know , bothered them . well , the homeless people - - i guess , they need their shopping cart , so they kind of went elsewhere , so - - um - - i mean it ' s a small thing , but it was , they just figured out , they were - - you know , uh - - learning from experience on what they need to do in the - - city and - - i think he would be a good - - candidate for the homeland security , running that .
b but , eh , for the foreign po - uh this is all all what you are saying is like , about the internal - - but what about the external policy or something like that ?
whom do you think would be suitable ?
a the what now policy ?
b like , eh , foreign po - or international policy or external or
a m ##hm .
b uh , whom do you think - - would be suitable for this position ?
a to run foreign policy ?
um - - like , uh - - well , it was - - colin powell was secretary , was he secretary of state ?
is that what that was ?
b yeah .
a and condo ##lee ##zza rice is going to step into that position , the way i understand it , uh .
b yeah , that ' s right .
a yes .
you know , she may be - - uh uh uh , you know , uh - - a uh bush yes person , you know , i do n ' t know , uh
b yeah , so i i do n ' t think this will change too much i mean .
a well mo - most - - most - - aide ##s to the president , if it was - - you know , i guess when it was clinton it was , they ' d probably be kind of yes people too , but , i mean they pick the person to - - you know , help them and i guess they ' re going to have to have - - phil ##oso ##phi ##es and and - - run it the way they would or way they ' d want , uh
b yeah , actually i agree with you .
i think uh - - during , uh , clinton time uh - - the uh like international policy or the external policy was - - was much better than - - uh what what is happening right now , so .
i think if we took bill cl ##in - bill clinton as like , as a foreign policy - - he he would be he will do a very good job .
i i would say .
a m ##hm .
b uh , do you think there is uh - - some other , uh like - - positions has to be has been - - has to be created , like uh - - for the next election .

a and at that point in time , he wanted to stay on , which was sort of sort of ridiculous .
b and if if if i do n ' t think the rest of the country knows that , because they do n ' t know what he did before nine eleven , because they do n ' t pay any attention .
a eh - - exactly .
exactly , of course , you ' re right , you ' re quite right .
b and - - i think that if he did get a government agency , it would have to be one that was having crisis a lot of times i mean , he would just have to devote himself to that .
if he could just do that , it would be fine .
a it ' s a good point .
b but if he gets if gets into a lot of policy making and stuff that for other things , you know ,
a yeah , yeah .
yeah , i i i i know i one of the
b i do n ' t know .
probably would be a good attorney general , he did that
a it could very well , he did a good job , you ' re right , he probably could follow in what ' s his name ' s footsteps .

i think i think the cases that he picks and chooses probably i would n ' t necessarily put on top of the list , but he did seem to
a right .

greg well - - yeah , no i , i think , i think ( ( the guy ' s ) ) definitely guilty uh just based on , i have n ' t followed it all that closely , although you ca n ' t help but follow it closely because there ' s so much crap on the news .
christina m ##hm .
greg but uh no i - the - - uh the i think well first of all , you know i agree with you , i think cheating on your wife ' s pretty low .
but i think what happened i - it ' s living the b - uh living large .
you could tell both of them uh you look some of the things they had , you know , he had a few bucks or so .
( ( ) ) finish , things were getting him down , uh you know , you know how it is , day after day though - - m - marriage is n ' t all that wonderful .
christina right .
greg eh , you know and i do n ' t think he had faced that , and plus , you know , a lot of the neat stuff from the outside , and particularly amber frey , who i do n ' t particularly think is neat , but it was something that uh you know he went after
christina m ##hm .
greg and so uh he figured , well - - these will , these things would get rid of her i guess .
i do n ' t , i do n ' t know why like his uh , the wife ' s or the mother said divorce is an option i think .
christina yeah .
i know , that ' s very powerful .
not , you know , not murder and , oh , i mean , i do n ' t know .
greg but - - you know , i i can see , the guy was n ' t thinking right .
he was screwed up , you know , a des ##pic ##able human being and he , just - - you know , the easy way out .
this ' ll work , i guarantee i ' m too damn smart .
christina but you know what , it ' s like i think they did n ' t want to find him guilty because remember when ~ o ##j was not found guilty ?
i mean , oh my god , the , you know , but it ' s like , ~ la would have like , turned ~ la upside down , like all the , you know
greg yeah .
christina i - it just , i do n ' t know what would happen if he was found guilty , but now i think they said that they wanted to prove that - - you know , okay , we ' re not going to let this guy walk , like , do n ' t let this guy walk either , big high profile case .
greg well , yeah you have to look , see , i think the local ##e , that both of them took place , and one took place in ~ la , which is terribly open - minded and , uh , the other one took place in uh , mid ##a - well , uh ( ( red ##oa ##k ) ) city .
christina m ##hm .
redwood city , yeah .
greg and who , redwood city is one of those things that would , uh shift san francisco and ~ la to , uh , to a red state rather than a blue state if you let them .
it ' s very , very conservative there .

what do you think ?

i think he got into an argument with her and he pushed her .
and i think she fell and maybe she hit her head or something and it killed her , so he panicked .
ali ##thi ##a what about the baby ?
a i do n ' t think he - - you know , i th ##i - i do n ' t know .
i don - eh , you know , because - - th - well , with the baby and stuff , you know , she was still pregnant at that time , so .

ali ##thi ##a how would - - did they , like , found , like , eh , you know , fingerprints or whatever ?
a um , no .
um , they brought the boat down , or a duplicate of the boat to , kind of , you know , get a feel for it but they had to remove it from redwood city because people were putting flowers in it in - - memory of lac ##i and , you know , planting flowers around it and stuff , so it was pretty interesting .

ali ##thi ##a oh , i thought it was just getting on ~ tv over here .

hillary a pretty - - de ##pressing topic for today .
kelly yeah , i guess so .
the truth is i do n ' t really , uh , i do n ' t really know much about that topic .
i did n ' t really follow the trial very closely at all
hillary we do n ' t have , uh , cable so we purposely did n ' t watch the trial , but i read about it on the internet .
kelly so
hillary and basically
kelly oh , really ?
hillary he - - killed his wife when she was - - eight months pregnant and - - and dumped her in , uh - - the ocean , basically .
kelly so why was it so special ?
why did that , uh - - particular case make - - the the national news ?
hillary i think it ' s because it was in such , it was like a , um
kelly like
hillary it was - - in such a quiet , upscale community where it happened and - - um just i think the fact of her being eight months pregnant , um , drew a lot of attention and
kelly yeah .
hillary of course people were worried about her for a long time and then they found her and blah blah blah .
it was - - gossip , basically .
kelly ( ( yeah , right . ) ) oh , but the mistress had nothing to do with the murder ?
hillary i think - - yeah , cause he found out , they found out he had a mistress , and then it was like , oh - - yeah .
are - - i do n ' t think , i do n ' t think so , but who knows ?
i do n ' t know .
kelly right .
hillary very sad cause she has a child herself and so she drug her son through a lot of - - uh , drama that he did n ' t need to be part of .
kelly wait , what happened ?
hillary i do n ' t know .
she has a son too , so he he also got put - - um - - you know , in the spotlight a bit , from what i understand .
i did n ' t , i do n ' t have tv though , so i do n ' t really know .
kelly oh , the son of the , right right .
hillary of - - of his girlfriend , yeah .
kelly yeah .
hillary i do n ' t know .
i hear though , that he ' s going to be - - the first person to be ( ( ) ) um - - uh - - killed for a crime in california in like , thirty five years or something .
oh .
kelly oh , really ?
hillary i do n ' t know if they ' ve , i do n ' t know if they ' ve - - um - - given him the death penalty yet .
but i think he would be the first in , in a really long time to actually - - be killed .
kelly yeah , that ' s amazing .
hillary i do n ' t
kelly um - - why , uh , now why did they decide that this was to be this big ( ( ) ) out of this with the most he ##ino ##us crime in all of california ?
hillary well , you know
kelly i mean i guess that ' s not how they decide who died , but it ' s because of the
hillary you know , and
kelly the , uh , co ##u - , like the - - the court that they went to , like the area does n ' t
hillary well , i do n ' t know why they decided on this , i think it was because it was so public of a case .
but they have a lot of
kelly yeah .
hillary they have many many worse crimes going on in california , parents killing their children and everything , that you would think - - would would , um - - you know , be
kelly hearing more .
hillary be more
kelly string ##ent penalties ,
hillary yeah , but they do n ' t , they ignore those because this one got on television , i guess .
kelly keep like - - uh , the jury from watching ~ tv and the media and stuff . but i guess now ( ( it ' s , uh ) ) - - pretty much impossible - - to do .
hillary i i do n ' t know .
i never really got the whole - - watching it on ~ tv and and getting into the whole - - mystery of it because , in the end , the woman ' s dead and so is her child and - - and - - there ' s - - really no way of changing that i guess .
kelly yeah , uh , i think it ' s kind of strange how it was so publicized .
like i ' m just , seriously , like i do n ' t , like i try not to watch , like - - too much , like
hillary you ca n ' t help it sometimes .
kelly yeah i know .
but it just ama ##zes me that , uh , i think it ' s ridiculous how publicized - - how much publicity it got because - - i mean there ' s like human rights violations going on all around the world .
i mean there ' s like , genocide in sudan right now but like , nobody talks about that . that ' s like ( ( ) )
hillary oh yeah and what ' s going on in , i know and people - - flock , flock to the store to buy all their - - all their foreign made goods and it ' s like what are you - - doing ?
obviously they do n ' t really care about what ' s going on .
they just like to hear the details .
maybe if they could hear the details about other things they would be more involved .
i do n ' t know .
kelly um ( ( ) ) it ' s almost like , uh - - ( ( ) ) diversion but it just seems like they just make it into like , like a soap opera for people to watch , you know ?
hillary well you know , some people were glued to their ~ tv ##s for weeks , and it ' s just to disturbing that that would be their - - their main entertainment during the day .
kelly oh yeah , definitely .
it ' s creepy .
hillary especially when there ' s so many other things they could be doing .
we have three kids .
i could not sit around all day and watch a murder trial on ~ tv , especially with my kids around .

glad to meet you .
well , the topic is interesting , but they ' ve been having this one for three days .
i do n ' t know why they ' re so obsessed with it .
mohammed seems like it ' s a weekend , or they want to get as much as they can feedback from people .
jean i guess so , yes .
mohammed and so what do you think was -
jean i i did n ' t actually - - watch the trial very much , uh th - in fact , i did n ' t watch the trial at all .
mohammed m ##hm .
jean i read about it in the newspaper and things like that .
um , i do think from all the , uh , things that i have heard that he - - had to be guilty with all the evidence that they had , but um , i do n ' t really know why , uh , if everybody was so , sort of , obsessed about it when we ' ve got so much other - - things going on in the world that , uh , seem to me much more important , but um .
perhaps it was because he seemed , uh , a very human kind of person and , and you co ##u - you could n ' t really understand why he would want to do something about that .
i - i think his motive must have been to be with his new girlfriend , but uh - - - kill his own first child that way is extraordinary .
what do you think ? mohamed ?
mohammed yeah .
jean and what do you - what do you think about it ?
mohammed being very frankly , i was not , uh , following the case at all even uh uh television , or uh reading , but from what i can observe , that it seems , eh , it has been talking - - - - taking too long time .
like one year almost , now .
it was -
jean when you what ?
mohammed it was - - taking so much time .
long time .
jean yes .
mohammed the case is almost one year .
like last , uh , christmas if i ' m not , uh , recalling my memory .
so for one year , it ' s really a good time . hu - so i ' m asking myself why it took such a long
jean hm .
mohammed it may be because - - it ' s quite important , or so there is so many everything ' s , i mean , it ' s , it ' s a really different case .
but , the quo - the nice quo ##tie ##nt is about the media .
but the media have biased in this ,
jean yes .
mohammed or not ?
i believe that media is a very good , uh , i mean , uh , way to give us all the opportunity to understand and see .
i mean without the media , you and i , how we will be knowing ?
jean no , exactly .
do you think they were biased in in - - favor of him , or in favor
mohammed i - - - no , i do n ' t think so .
jean no , i did n ' t think so either from what i heard .
mohammed maybe - - sometimes in - in - in - in other issues they - they may be biased , but in this issue they were just - - covering what ' s happening ,
jean yes .
mohammed and , uh , they give us the picture .
it was a camera - - to give you the view .
i do n ' t think they were biased in this case here .
jean yes .
no .
mohammed and , uh , what do you think will happen next ?
jean well , uh they ' re coming up to the sentencing , and i heard yesterday or read in the newspaper or something that his brother - - i guess it was on the television .
in the news , his brother was appealing - - for them to to sentence him to - - to prison for life rather than the death penalty , because - - he said he ' s a very good listener and he cares about people , and and he might be able to help a lot of people in prison .
i do n ' t know whether that is true or not .
i know that he had done a lot of volunteer things before , and that was the one things that made me wonder there was any possible chance that it could have been somebody else who did it .
i think given such as i have heard , even though like you , i did not follow the case day by day or anything like that , i do n ' t quite see how he could not be guilty if they ' ve got so much that appears to point to him .
and what would be the motive for anybody trying to - - to get him if it was n ' t
mohammed yeah .

gandhi okay , mark .
uh , i think it ' s fresh topic for tonight .
marco yeah , yeah .
good topic .
it ' s a good topic .
gandhi so what do you think ?
marco well , um , i would - i would have to start - - - i would have to start , generally , in stating - - - stating what i think is the problem and - - - with the middle east and what - for me , one of the major problems is the fact that - - the - - united states government gives so much aid to the state of israel .
in which , the state of israel buys - - many expensive military weapons , ah , which is used to - - op ##press and - - to kill a lot of palestinians .
so , for me , that ' s - - the - that ' s essentially the root of the problem .
and , um , ya ##sser ara ##fat was kind of in a difficult position , because you have these , um , incredibly - - op ##pressed and in some ways imprisoned , uh , palestinians , and if - - ara ##fat had n ' t , um , tried to stand up - - and help them and - and fight for their rights , then - - m - they would n ' t have respected ara ##fat , but then again , you know , he could n ' t be too friendly with the west , um , and , um , and so he did the best he could , i think .
it ' s a difficult - - leadership role .
gandhi m ##hm .
marco yeah .
um , what do - well , how about you ?
gandhi i think , yeah , more or less , i c - i agree with what you said .
it ' s almost , this is my view as well .
and the question is , what next ?
i mean , some idea - - from israeli side , they were saying - - he was a problem , and if he goes , everything will be quite easy .
marco yeah .
gandhi fine .
now he ' s not in anymore .
marco yeah .
gandhi so , let us wait and see .
hope .
if he was a problem himself , hope - uh , the coming one - - will be in a good - - position to negotiate with the other side , israel , and then - - peace can be achieved .
marco yeah .
gandhi uh , we have to wait and see , but , uh , it seems it ' s not easy .
marco but , i , eh , i get the feeling that - - - it ' s almost - - - the peace process - we ca n ' t put it on - - the ro - or the - - - the whole responsibility of the pre - - - peace process ca n ' t be the leader of - - a - - - a group that is - - - i do n ' t know , in my view , has - - not ve ##r - not very many resources to fight - - - to fight this - - battle that - - their trying to fight against - - a government that has taken away a lot of their land , that , you know , does n ' t allow them to really move around in their own country .
so , unless that - - stops , the , um , the leader of the palestinians - - really ca n ' t do too much - - to further the peace process , because - - there are - - a lot of bad things happening to the people - - of that - - leader .
gandhi that ' s correct , as well .
marco yeah , so it ' s - - - it ' s kind of , it ' s - - - it seems like the , um , the media , at least in the united states , is - - putting all of this - - focus and responsibility on the leader of the palestinians , as if it was
gandhi
marco ara ##fat ' s fault that any of - - - any of the violence was caused .
so , it seems like an unfair treatment - - of - - - of , you know , the leader of - - the palestinian people .
um , yeah .
gandhi yes .
that ' s absolutely correct .
yeah .
marco yeah .
hm .
gandhi actually , it - it ' s a good topic to be choosing , i mean , uh , because it ' s one of the fresh topics .
marco yeah .
gandhi how long have you been with the study ?
marco uh , this is probably my tenth or eleventh conversation .
gandhi tenth , eleven .
almost the same like me .
so , the other - - days , which one was quite interesting to you ?
marco um , well , there ' s been a couple where - - they ' ve - they talked about the cabinet - - for - - bush , and bush has been , um , you know , selecting new cabinet members and - - all of the new members are people that i ' m - i do n ' t really know very well .
so , there ' s been some topics where i ' m - i did n ' t have very much information .
other topics - - you know , usually about the election that - - - that , um , i did have - - a lot of things , um , to say .
yeah .
are you - are you , um , are you from the united states , or do you come from , uh -
gandhi i came from the area , i ' m from egypt .
marco you ' re from egypt .
gandhi yeah , so i ' m - i ' m quite , uh ,
marco so you -
gandhi - ce ##rned about , uh - - - uh , over there i mean .

sue oh , you do ?
ben yeah .
yeah .
sue well , good for you .
ben and we ' re talking about ara ##fat here .
sue yes , ara ##fat .
let ' s talk about ara ##fat .
what do you think ?
ben huh .
what do i think ?
um , well , when - - around the time he was he was getting the nobel peace prize and stuff , i think he got that .
sue yes , he did .
ben um , there was a show here in new york at a big theater .
i think maybe it was at lincoln center in the philharmonic theater or the metropolitan opera house or the new york state theater or something . and ara ##fat came in and got a standing o ##vation , you know , a peace prize winner ba ##h ba ##h ba ##h ba ##h ba ##h .
the mayor of new york , who was then rudolph gi ##ulia ##ni , stood up and walked out , he was also in attendance , and his , uh , comment to the press afterwards was that , you know , he just did n ' t want to honor a terrorist , and i - - one of the few things that i was happy about with gi ##ulia ##ni when he was mayor .
sue m ##hm .
ben uh , gi ##ulia ##ni got very popular later because of the - the
sue nine eleven .
ben world trade center thing but he - he was n ' t so popular as a mayor .
sue yeah .
right , i knew that .
ben but , you know , i - i kind of agreed with that ara ##fat thing , though .
i - - but i do think he accomplished something in that the palestinian people do have a legitimate gr ##ie ##vance and he put it on the map , you know .
sue well , he - - - he did but i think he really failed mis ##era ##bly , in my opinion , when he , um , refused to sign that treaty that was originally set up because it was a wonderful - - option and it really could ' ve re - done some wonderful things for his people and i think he really did them a di ##sser ##vic ##e by not taking care of it at that time .
ben uh - huh .
uh - huh .
yeah , what was the treaty ?
i ' m not familiar with it .
sue well , um , where they were going to , uh , give them , like , ninety - six percent of the ga - of - of gaza and he said that he wanted all hundred percent .
and so he refused to sign it .
it was just an - an incredible faux pas on his part , from my opinion .
ben oh .
yeah .
yeah , y - it ' s - it ' s - - you have to sometimes take a little bit less than you want , you know , uh , an - and ninety - six percent is a big percentage , you know .
sue yes .
and i think that could have really done some wonderful uh steps for - - uh for the palestinian people uh as a whole .
and i felt - - very sad that , um , that that was n ' t - - done .
it really should ' ve been .
um , it was really quite unfortunate that - that he - - that he was not willing to , um , step forward - - to do - do what was really in the best interests of his people .
ben sometimes - sometimes i th - i think it ' s hard when - when you ' re the - the first leader , or the george washington of something , to see things other than in black and white .
you know , or maybe he did n ' t have the gift of - of nu ##ance that would ' ve helped him to - - - to take that right step , uh , you know , the - - - the - - his people suffer so terribly and maybe , you know , it could have been better if he had signed that , huh .
sue i really think so .
i really , truly do and now it ' s a - a situation where , with his passing , um , i think there ' s a real , um , new opening , a new possibility for - - - some extremely positive steps to come forward out of this - - i do think that the united states - - will probably be requested to be involved in the negotiation process and i understand that , i me - uh , because , um , i think - - both sides - - have a trust in the united states that make it -
ben and we ' ve ha - we have a history , uh , clinton and carter w - worked over there - - - try to get some peace going .
they they they worked very personally .
they had those retreat ##s and things with the leaders ,
sue right .
ben arm - twisting sessions .
and stuff , and uh - - that ' s why we should be there but i ' m i ' m kind of scared of the people - - that represent the united states now , you know .
they ' re not quite the same caliber .
sue well , that ' s really true , um , but it - it is a - - i mean , we are having a - a - - step forward in a lot of ways , um .
we - we , i think , do have some potential ##s , um , to do some extremely positive , um , um , things .

paul wow .
opposite sides of the coast .
rain ##ia yeah .
well , that ' s an interesting question they ' re asking .

i ' m happy to talk about it .
rain ##ia yeah , go right ahead .
paul well , um , ya ##sser ara ##fat was - - was he a good leader ?
i i think - - that , uh , he - - he ' s - - pretty much - - - - or he was pretty much - - following what he had always done , even as a young man , uh , back in algeria - - when - when he led the - - terrorist attacks against the french to kick them out of - - algeria .
and i - i think he was doing the same thing there in palestine .
i - i do n ' t think , eh , i do n ' t think he really knew how to , uh , take on the role of - of peace ##maker .
you know , i ' m - i ' m - - you know , i could be wrong .
that ' s just my opinion .
but i - it seems like that - that was always a problem for him .
hm .
rain ##ia yeah .
um , i ' m not sure myself uh how good a leader he was .
i i - - it ' s hard to get the truth w - when the - - when the there ' s so many uh slant ##ed uh - - information
paul yeah .
rain ##ia especially on the main media .
paul that ' s true .
rain ##ia i do n ' t - - like the way - - israel has been - - going after the palestinians
paul right .
i - i agree .
i think ariel sharon is a lot like ya ##sser ara ##fat . and i - - ca n ' t understand why the two of them - - did n ' t see the similarities .
rain ##ia yeah .
um , and they were asking - - too , of - - about the , should the ~ us be involved - - in that whole thing ?
paul yeah .
that - that ' s interesting , too , because - - cutting ya ##sser ara ##fat out of the whole thing was - - - was really - - george bush ' s decision .
i think - - personally , he did n ' t like him because he thought he was a - - - a liar - - so he refused to - - have anything to do with him .
and , uh , th -
rain ##ia uh , which - which bush are you talking about ?
paul george ~ w bush .
rain ##ia oh , ok - yeah .
paul ( ( ) )
rain ##ia well -
paul ev - everything kind of stopped when - - - when he became president and all , uh , activity regarding - - israel , palestine stopped .
and israel pretty much could do what they wanted .
an - and you ' re right , it did n ' t seem fair at all .
rain ##ia yeah , there ' re - - th - well , the way i see it , eh , bush , eh , has a right - - wing christian , right - wing agenda .
he he ' s - - some - - how thinks that - - if israel has - - - - i ' m not sure that all - - their prop ##he ##cies are - - but there ' s something about - - if - - they can - - get rid of the palestinians , that will somehow , um , their prophecy - - coming true and th - and then - - somehow - - i do n ' t - - i - we do n ' t - - understand what on earth they ' re
paul that sounds - -
rain ##ia trying to achieve with this but i - it seems like a -
paul that sounds kind of scary .
rain ##ia a christian agenda , yeah , that that - - that , uh , the end of the world , the end times - - if , um , israel takes over - - palestine that ' s h - some - - has something to do with the end times .
it ' s really - - frightening the way they talk - - and , um , i do n ' t think he ' s qualified to be involved in this at all .
it never was right to begin with n - and , you know , we - we ' re - we ' re only given certain information and
paul m ##hm .
rain ##ia hard to really know the whole - - real story of what ' s going on over there .
but i do know
paul right .
rain ##ia that what the israelis are doing is wrong .
by going into their territory and building these walls or building settlements - - pushing the palestinians out and - - palestinians - - fight - - with rocks and - - sticks and - - israelis have their machine guns and bull ##do ##zers and - - i just - - t - really un ##pala ##table that the - - whole idea , the - - the way they ' re going about - - this thing and - - i do n ' t really feel qualified - - to say how it should be , but - - i - - see it - - being wrong to - - hurt children and - - innocent people .

so , what do you think about - - ara ##fat ?
was he a h -
roger uh , i think that , um , i bet he was n ' t a really good leader .
i think that , um , that his situation - - - - well , see i got to the - - to - to the level of power that he was in - - back in the eighties - - and once he , um , you know , started getting wealthy and started getting known , that his agenda ch - uh , changed
bar ##b m ##hm .
roger but it was n ' t actually for peace but was to try to find a way to ( ( send ) ) the israelis out of jerusalem in the areas that they wanted . i really do n ' t think that - - they wanted to coe ##xi ##st .
i think that , um , he wanted - - you know , all his people - - all his people wanted to coe ##xi ##st with the - - israelis .
i think that , um , his death - - marks a beginning of trying to find somebody that - - really wants peace .
i do n ' t think that in that area of the , um , world that you could actually have peace .
if you know the bible well you would know that there ' s always going to be a conflict there .
um , i think that , uh , the united states should open up - - their - - doors to - - not help , but support any , um , process for peace in the area , though .
i do n ' t think that we should get involved to a level , a point where we ' re sending people over there and , um , trying to - - help keep the peace or anything like that , um .
there ' s a lot of stuff that can be done - - by just verbal su ##pp ##o - - - you know .
i think that now he ' s gone , his family is still around , and
bar ##b yeah .
roger uh , millions and millions of dollars that he had is still around but they - - if they bring people in that was n ' t involved with his cabinet , n - um , have different views than him , somebody that gene ##r - genuinely can accept the fact that the israel - - - is - israelis are there and they ' re there to stay - - and , um , we going to have to find a way to coe ##xi ##st .
if they can find somebody like that , then i think that they should f - support him and , um , and back him up - - in trying to help define - - peace in the area where peace is impossible .
what do you think about it ?
bar ##b i agree with you .
i did n ' t know that much about it , i was n ' t much into politics back in the eighties .
i was more , um , kind of a - - i was a kid on the run from abusive parents back then so that was n ' t a , you know , one of my topics of interest at the time , it is now .
um , i - - my roommate , and i still do n ' t know that much about - - i ' d love to know more about politics and i ' m trying to learn more , uh , tells me , you know , he was such a terrible man but , eh , i do n ' t listen to everything he says .
and i think it - - - - i mean , it would be nice to have peace over there , but i agree with you , i do n ' t think it ' s ever going to happen .
i mean , not the way - - - - not the way they ' ll - - - - not like it is here .
and i agree that we should n ' t send people over there .
we ' ve got enough stuff going on with
roger yeah .
bar ##b iraq and i - and , um , the - - other - - - - the other guy .
roger yeah .
bar ##b we got way too much going and too much expense , i mean , we we ca n ' t , the that ' s
roger yeah .
bar ##b that would be just putting it over the edge right there .
but i think ought support , you know , a man that ,
roger m ##hm .
bar ##b like you said , is - - would like to coe ##xi ##st - - with everybody and somebody that is
roger yeah .
bar ##b peaceful - - and , i do n ' t know , i ' d like to learn more about the bible . my parents never took me to church or anything .
but , um ,
roger yeah .
bar ##b i ' d like to - - i know that , you know , there ' s been problems , a lot of conflict over there , and it seems like no matter what ,
roger ah .
bar ##b just like iraq ye - eh , we try to go in and get peace and - and how long has it been and , i mean , i think saddam needed to be removed but it ' s - - - there ' s just - - s - all these people that are going to follow him no matter what .
roger yeah , and , um , i only know about ya ##sser ara ##fat because i , um , study international affairs a little bit - - and i know - - a very little bit about him because , of course he was a , um , leader for a long time , longer than the age that i am - - old , so , but i - i - i - i ' ve noticed - - on throughout my studies that - - what he represented to the public - - was - - what he represented to the international public - - was not what he was representing to his people - - and he was representing , um , peace with the israelis and he was representing trying to find ( ( the whites or ) ) divide the land so that it would be , um , stop , um , uh , war and terrorists in the area .
but i do n ' t think that he had the same image to - to his people .
i think that it was a front - - for him to allow to to be accepted in an international community , but i think - - that his ultimate plans and goals were to to run the israelis out - - maybe closer to the gaza strip , and to re - take jerusalem - - and other cities near jerusalem , and to , uh , up ##lift his people in a way that - - they could say , you know , we conquered the israelis .
it ' s a matter of , uh - - i mean , it ' s more than just land , it ' s a , um , conflict of - - - of , um , hatred , uh , and racism , i mean , eh , different types of people , um , they do n ' t like each other ,

i - i - - - i would say he was a good leader - - for - - - for , uh , his people .
and as far as our involvement there , should be as little as possible .
just let them do - - what they , you know , what they ' re going to do - - and we should stay out of it ( ( just ) ) as - - much as we can . uh , this country seems to get involved too much in other people ' s politics .
should just let them do whatever they ' re going to do ,
ali uh ,
mark you know .
ali mm , by the way i am from arab origin , so i also have , uh , uh , the same opinion - - like you .
i believe he - - - - in my opinion he - he was a good leader - - and , um , i believe what , eh , has to be done - - right now is to ( ( apply ) ) - - the united nations ' , uh , decisions about the conflict between arab and israel because there is - - - - there are a lot of , uh , decisions have been made - - have been made - - and this , uh - for example , one of them was , uh , decision number two forty - two - - and this was about - - the ha - establishing two - two countries , one for israel and another one for palestine .
mark right .
ali so , if we - - - - eh , if united states , bush , israel ( ( told ) ) th - the solution or to , uh , to make the decision , eh , i think this will solve - - the problem .
the - - unfortunately what happens right now - - - the - - for example , which is - - little bit toward it ' s - it ' s interest .
for example , when there was , uh , like , a - - decision against iraq , the united states - - went directly - - to iraq to - - - - for , eh , uh , an invasion - - and - - for - - whatever reasons - - - she even was out , uh , putting any attention to the united nations , uh , like , uh , approval .
she did w ##ha - what she want .
but , eh , eh , for israeli , palestinian conflict there ' s a lot of decisions that has to be - - applied but until now - - she did n ' t put any pressure , eh , toward ( ( this and ) ) and i believe this policy has been , uh , this kind of policy , eh , um , eh , became more and more during - - eh , during , uh , eh , bush - - - - president bush time .
for example , before , eh , during clinton , i believe at that time - - clinton was trying hard - - to solve this problem and i believe at that time , if you remember , um , ya ##sser ara ##fat - - and , uh , the prime minister of israel , his name was barak , they met together in the white house - - and - - they almost came to an agreement - - to solve this problem - - and during clinton , eh , period - - they had , uh , this ( ( oslo ) ) a - eh , agreement .
most of the big problems between the two parties , they negotiated everything almost and there is - - there were , like , final steps that have to be solved .
but , uh , i think if there was , like , the , um , the same policy has to be followed after clinton .
i think - - everything would - - - - finished then - - - the - - i think united states - - went to another direction and , eh , they forgot about this problem right now .
mark yeah , i g - eh , see , i do n ' t ,
ali
mark um , when - when policy is set by one - - - - by one president - - towards - towards one thing , it ' s usually - - followed through , if there is something to follow through , by the - - next president in turn .
he is more or less ob ##liga ##ted - - to continue , uh , the process that was already started - - but - - i think - - bush ' s - - agenda - - is not - - towards that right now . that is not his priority , i do n ' t think .
ali yeah , i think so , yes .
mark and , eh , uh , although , you know , it ' s been a long time - - that - - i - they have both - - b - both israel and palestine , they both need a - - they both need their own country - - and -
ali that ' s , uh , true because , uh ,
mark an - - - eh , y -
ali in the united nations they have established - - eh , they made this decision already .
mark r - right , right .
ali the - - uh , there , uh - - there has to be two countries , one of them for palestine ,
mark right .
ali and another one for israeli but , uh ,
mark i - i - i agree a hundred percent , uh ,
ali because , eh , i -
mark eh , but to get so involved in it .
i think , the people , uh , the people that are in charge , the - eh , the people that run the governments there - - do need to sit down an - and - and be in touch with each other and if they need a media ##tor or something like that , that -
ali which is played by u - united states .

ir ##vin ~ wi - - okay .
okay .
you ' re in michigan , huh ?
win ##nett ##e yeah ?
ir ##vin all right .
uh , what do you know about this scott - - peterson trial ?
i do n ' t know much about it , to be honest with you .
win ##nett ##e oh this is funny because i just , one of my calls the other day was regarding this .
ir ##vin really ?
win ##nett ##e so uh uh they ' re act - - - actually that ' s getting a few different questions and - - actually the gentleman i got the other day - - had n ' t even heard about it .
um ,
ir ##vin oh really ?
win ##nett ##e well um , i ' ve been following it pretty closely .
um , i guess because of - - you know it being a mother and - - being pregnant for a baby .
ir ##vin oh , uh - huh .
win ##nett ##e um , kind of hit more to - - i you know to home .
um , so you - - how much of it have you followed ?
did , did you - - follow any of it at all when it was on in the news or in the papers or anything ?
ir ##vin hardly any of it at all , because - - um - - for one thing - - i do not have a ~ tv or a radio and i do n ' t get a daily newspaper .
we get
win ##nett ##e oh wow .
ir ##vin we get a weekly newspaper .
win ##nett ##e okay .
um , well i ' ll i do n ' t get any newspapers at the house , but - - i listen to the radio every morning on my way to work and
ir ##vin oh yeah ?
win ##nett ##e and uh - - when it first happened it was - - pretty publicized on every radio station um - - it come across - - on the news and we keep our ~ tv on at my work , because we have a customer waiting area , so
ir ##vin oh , uh - huh .
win ##nett ##e um actually one of our employees had wa - watched ( ( happening ) ) - - so from that point on we kind of - - talked a lot about it at work and
ir ##vin how long ago was it ?
win ##nett ##e different things .
um , it was a year - - almost a year ago .
over a year ago ?
because it was just before christmas - - that it happened .
ir ##vin over a year ago .
win ##nett ##e yeah .
um , i ' m thinking - - i do n ' t know , november , december , i ' m not sure exactly .
but i know it was just before christmas - - when they had uh - - it had happened , because she was missing during christmas and then they had found her body .
and they - - they found the baby as well .
ir ##vin terrible .
win ##nett ##e um , so when they found the baby , the baby of course had been - - they do n ' t know if the baby was born , through delivery , or - - if maybe from um - - the corpse i guess
ir ##vin so the baby was separate .
win ##nett ##e maybe extracted it .
um , actually she was pregnant for the baby .
ir ##vin but the baby was separate from the body when he found it ?
win ##nett ##e yes .
yep .
um , i do n ' t know if ma - i you know i do n ' t know the whole story for sure , but - - um - - he had - - you know , obviously - - denied that he was involved anything to do with it .
then they found out that he was having an affair on her .
and - - then of course when they were investigating him - - he tried running .
dyed his hair and - - grew out a mustache and - - they caught him trying to run with - - quite a bit of cash .
ir ##vin wow .
win ##nett ##e so i mean ,
ir ##vin ( ( ) )
win ##nett ##e he ' s - - in all honesty been guilty all along the way but
ir ##vin uh - huh .
win ##nett ##e of course you know they ' ve got to give him that reasonable doubt .
ir ##vin uh - huh .
so is he is he still um - - in prison now ?
win ##nett ##e yeah .
and they ' re making the determination if - - in fact he will get the death penalty , or life in prison .
so that ' s what ' s is up in the air right now .
ir ##vin what state is this in ?
win ##nett ##e california .
ir ##vin it ' s in california .
win ##nett ##e and - - um - - i know i had , it was supposed to have be deliberate ##d on - - the twenty - second of november , but they had an issue happen with - - one of the ju ##ror ##s - - so it ' s postponed everything .
but , actually they were trying to pass a law , and i do n ' t know if it ever did take into effect , that if in fact a mother was killed , and pregnant , um - - for there to be a double murder charge .
ir ##vin oh , uh - huh .
win ##nett ##e and - - they were in fact trying to enforce the death penalty on that charge if they were - - found guilty on both charges .
ir ##vin uh - huh .
win ##nett ##e and - - so it ' s kind of up in the air now - - because he - - i believe he got first degree murder and - - um and then got mans ##lau ##ght ##er on the baby .
so he did n ' t get both first degree murders .
ir ##vin what ' s the difference ?
win ##nett ##e where - - um , i guess because he did n ' t murder the baby directly .
ir ##vin oh .
win ##nett ##e i ' m thinking maybe was the difference .
and because of the the charge on the baby , they could n ' t automatically give him the death penalty , but - - obviously there ' s enough - - um , complaints or whatever
ir ##vin what was his excuse for doing something horrible like that ?
win ##nett ##e and - - well he still denies everything .
he has never admitted
ir ##vin ( ( still does ) )
win ##nett ##e to do it .
um - - but the only thing they can figure is that maybe - - he wanted back into the bachelor life , and did n ' t want to be a father , did n ' t want to be tied down with a wife and child
ir ##vin so he did n ' t have any other children ?
win ##nett ##e that was - - no , that was going to be their first .
and actually i do n ' t even think they were married that long , maybe a year or two .

if you did n ' t vote , why not ?
lynn hi , my name is lynn .

lynn oh , how are you ?
dave pretty good .
lynn oh , so the topic is elections .
dave right .
lynn um , i did vote
dave i did also .
lynn and i voted for , uh , not bush .
dave well , i guess , uh , you voted for kerry then , right .
lynn yes , i did .
dave yeah , are you in a blue or a red state ?
lynn i ' m sorry ?
dave a blue or a red state ?
lynn i ' m from missouri - - i ' m in missouri .

lynn well i b - really do n ' t even look at it like that , but i should know that , should n ' t i ?
dave yeah , i ' m in indiana - - so , uh ,
lynn and we were kind of split in the middle i think so i do n ' t know . maybe we ' re half blue and half red .
dave yeah .
lynn so , you voted for bush , then ?
dave no , i i voted for kerry .
lynn oh , you did , too .
oh , okay .
dave but , uh , i live in a kind of a staunch ##ly - - republican state .
so , there was really no way for my vote to make a difference .
lynn which , you know , i i just think the electoral votes - - i do n ' t know what ' s wrong with everybody just taking , you know , a head count and voting
dave yeah .
lynn and doing away with the * elector ##ials .
dave well , you know , you ' re you ' re talking about , um , the constitution there , so , i mean , you know , it takes a lot to change the constitution .
i know they ' re also - - i ' ve been reading some articles lately about they ' re - - thinking about , uh , uh , why should only a native born person be allowed to , uh , be president .
lynn oh , i know .
that is kind of interesting to - - think that , i mean , i think it ' ll be a long time before - - they would change that .
dave yeah , but , uh , just in the last uh , well , actually just in the last month or so i - - is really the only time i ' ve ever heard anybody even even talk about it .
and , uh , well , i i - - i did read a a column today by , uh , a hispanic fellow and , uh , he was n ' t native born , he was from cuba , and , uh , he stated that , uh , we he was in the fifth grade and and , uh , uh , he was taking - - no , i guess he was in middle school and he was taking a civic ##s class and and it was pointed out to him that , you know , he could never become president .
and he stated at that time , you know , he said , well , okay i ca n ' t be president i ' ll never , you know , get involved in politics .
so , you know , he kind of thought that was unfair .
lynn well , you know , in one sense it is but then , i mean - - well , my grandparents came over , ellis island and everything , but when i think about , you know , a foreign person or maybe born in another country and coming here it doe - it does n ' t seem right in one sense for - - for them to be able to be president of this country .
dave right .
lynn but - - it kind of falls like - - i mean i ' ve been on the internet lately and i ' ve ran across these really weird websites - - and i ' m not a fan ##atic or anything but they ' re all about the - - the new world , one world government and things like that , you know , and to me it ' s just another point in that direction .
maybe eventually , you know ,
dave uh - huh .
lynn that wo n ' t make a you know , twenty or thirty , forty , fifty years down the road .
dave right , eh , so what do you think about george bush ?
eh , are
lynn i i think he ' s a ph ##ony .
i mean , that ' s another thing they were talking about that he is with the skull and bones from i think he went to yale ,
dave right .
lynn and so was his father and and clinton was , too , and and people actually that + al ##umi ##na
dave and kerry was a skull and bones , also .
lynn also , yeah , and then they - - i do n ' t know what else they ' re called but they ' re saying , like , they were like satan people , satan worship ##ers and ,
dave oh .
lynn you know , and you do n ' t know what to believe .
i watched a show on channel nine about bush and him being religious , spiritual , of course , but also religious when his father was n ' t , and - - i do n ' t know . you know , you he ##a - i i think it ' s all a bunch of lies , and - - i i do n ' t i ' m not crazy about bush .
there ' re some things about him , you know , the fact that he does act spiritual and things like that , i like that , i think that ' s what got him in office but ,
dave uh - huh .
lynn um
dave well what do you think of him as a man ?
do you think he ' s , uh , a good man or do you think he ' s got - - any good qualities , or
lynn uh , i - - you know , i want to say that he probably is but then i look at the things like where he wants - - the things he ' s done .
i think that people are poorer .
i mean , i just think the um , we ' re so much more in debt .
i just do n ' t think he - - - - but as far as the man himself , i again , i do n ' t know .
dave yeah .
lynn what do you think of him ?
dave well , i i think i think his dad was a better man than he is .
you know , to me , you know , i ' m kind of in the same boat you ' re in .
i think he was just he ' s kind of the si ##zzle , you know , he ' s not the steak .

ob ##o oh , nice , sounds like it ' s a lot warmer down there .
ted oh yeah , sun ' s shining , it ' s a beautiful day .
ob ##o yeah , i guess the elections , ah - - basically , who did you vote for , and the vice presidential candidates , and why , and i ' ll be honest with you
ted yeah , go ahead .
ob ##o i did n ' t vote for either of those .
ted oh okay .
ob ##o i did vote , but i i do n ' t vote for the main party
ted uh - huh .
ob ##o ever , i usually try to stay out of the main party , because i think , and this last election showed that both are very brutal .
ted it was
ob ##o um , yeah i think that the , uh
ted election .
ob ##o oh , i ' m sorry .
ted it was a very brutal election .
ob ##o yeah , yeah , it ' s , yeah , you ' re absolutely , yeah , and i ' m sorry , i mean , if you want to add anything i ' m sorry .
ted no no , go ahead , go ahead .
ob ##o and , ah - - it ' s , it ' s just that - - like , i i just , i think that the last fifty years , the government has been me ##s - messed up by both these parties , honestly .
even maybe before that .
so , i , i usually do third party - - um , and the way it was working this year was that the democrats really pushed to get ralph nad ##er off the ballot
ted yeah .
yeah they did .
ob ##o in every state , and um - - i mean , the republicans sort of tried to play like they were helping him out , but they knew they they did n ' t really have to because they knew the democrats were already doing more damage to keep him off the ballot and they were successful , and for a progressive party that was very brutal .
ted m ##hm , it was .
ob ##o and i was n ' t really impressed by either of the two vice presidential candidates , i know dick cheney seems to be running the show
ted you know ?
ob ##o and , ah - - i mean , and , and a lot of it has to do - - and then , i just did n ' t know much , john edwards seemed nice , but he just , you know , he was just , he just got elected to the senate , and , i was n ' t really familiar too much with hi - i mean , i think it ' s great that he got into the vice presidential role , but - - again , it ' s the whole parties that i ' m really not really i do n ' t like their policies .
ted well , you kind of hit on some of my sentiments , um , i ' m a fifty - year - old black male , and this was my first election that i participated in .
and the reason was was that , ah , i ' m retired air force - - and before , ah , because i was in the military - - ah , did n ' t did n ' t really think that my vote , um , counted one way or the other , that ' s that was my thinking .
you know , i had a role to fulfill and regardless of how i voted , uh , i was going to have to fulfill that role .
um ,
ob ##o yeah .
ted the , the situation , though , now that i ' m out and , in the civilian sector , um , i find that the economics as far as home - - is what i ' m most concerned with .
and because of the economic situation , i do n ' t think that ' s being addressed .
yes , i feel very , very bad in regards to the , ah , nine - eleven tragedy and terrorism and this kind of stuff
ob ##o m ##hm .
ted um , but i think so much attention is being paid to that - - that - - as you mentioned , over the past fifty years , the two parties that run the country - - um , have definitely taken a , um - - streamlined approach to whatever their agenda may be and not the will of the people .
ob ##o you said it very well .
i totally , you co ##ul - i could n ' t have said it better .
ted now it ' s uh - - and as time goes on , you know , like , ah , what are we , you know , headed for , what are we faced with ?
ob ##o i i
ted i mean , if we do n ' t start looking inward and start taking care of things at home - - uh , right now , yeah , we are the biggest power in the world .
i heard a commentary by rush limb ##au ##gh , ah , the other day , and the comment was made was that there always is going to be a big dog on the street .
and right now i ' m proud to be , ah , you know , behind the big dog , meaning the united states .
if i - if if - - the united states is not the big dog , some power in the world is going to step up and be just that .
we got so many crises and tension uh what do you - - hot spots in the world , that , uh , instead of getting better , it seems to be growing .
we got , uh , what is it , iran ?
uh , right behind iraq there .
and then north korea , which is , you know , always volatile . uh , you know , those situations are not getting any better , you know ?
ob ##o you ' re absolutely right , yes .

derek uh , with their views because of different things like abortion and , and , uh , pro - life and - - all that kind of thing so i came form that background
marco uh huh .
derek eh , but that was just an added bonus for me in the fact that - - i too was obviously at this point in time concerned about the welfare of our security - - and i felt personally that if - - kerry was in office we ' d kind of be , uh - - up a creek without a paddle because i think - - he is so laid back - - um , and not as aggressive as bush that at this point in the game , where we ' re at - - we ' re in this thing full full - - steam ahead
marco uh huh .
derek and for a transition to occur at this point - - to someone who is laid back - - and not as aggressive as him i think would actually end ##anger the ~ us even more .
marco yeah .
derek i think that the international , uh uh , leaders would look at kerry and know , they ' re very smart , i mean they ' re - - they ' re on top of these things , they know , you know , it would , it just would have opened a gateway .
marco uh huh .
derek i feel
marco yeah .
derek that , uh , it may have actually put us in more danger .
at least bush has - - pulled out the gun , you know , stick to them , and um - - you know , that ' s where i was coming from on that .
marco yeah .
derek and then when i
marco ( ( do you think ) )
derek i listen to a lot of talk radio and when i heard the stuff about kerry back in the - - the the , apparently the scandals he ' s pulled as far as the uh , medals when he served time .
marco uh huh .
derek you know , uh - - i listen to a lot of talk radio and spoke with , you know , heard from a lot of , uh - - veterans - - and they said it was physically , uh , impossible for him to achieve what he said he did .
marco uh huh .
uh huh .
derek and all the meetings he ' s missing , and just , you know , i think it ' s more of a status quo for him .
marco yeah .
derek i think he ' s more , he got so much money that i think he was just concerned with attaining this position and a title .
marco yeah .
derek you know ( ( flag ) ) for him , so
marco do you think , um - - the - - when the republicans are campaigning - - they were saying that well , another attack on the u . s . is - - imminent , that it probably - - probably going to happen - - and - - um - - and - - they even went so far to say that if - - it ' s really difficult to prevent something like this and of course they ' re doing the best they can and - - i think kerry would do the best he could .
but do you think , um - - that - - and this is n ' t quite a political issue , but do you think that - - there ' s going to be another attack on the ~ us ?
uh like in the next five years ? something big like - - the world ( ( ) )
derek i , i do n ' t know what your beliefs are , as far as , uh - - biblical ##ly or spiritual ##ly or whatever , but - - i believe it ' s inevitable .
i mean , we ' re going down , you know ?
and , yeah , and this is , all these things have been written about actually .
marco really ?
derek um - - the t ##w - the uh - - what is it , the towers , uh - - that was actually uh there ' s references to that in the bible .
marco yeah , i ' ve heard , i ' ve heard about that .

ed good .
james well , what do you think ?
ed i think i was on this one yesterday , same subject .
james i , i believe i ' ve talked about this subject once before too .
ed uh , well , let ' s see , my past views were , uh - - illness - wise , ah - - i do n ' t think - - it helped him , being in the compound .
james right .
right .
ed but , you ' re , you know , you ' re never going to know if there was any , ah , clandestine - type operation that - - aided his , ah - - ah , illness .
james m ##hm .
ed i think that they , ah , ( ( ) ) , i do n ' t think you ' re ever going to find out if there was any direct
james right .
ed tam ##per ##ing
james right .
ed but i do n ' t , you know , from just the generic point , or general point of view , it did n ' t help his illness once he got - - sick - - being in the compound , closed in like that with the arabs .
james right .
right .
ed and that
james i do n ' t - - i do n ' t know if i think there was something - - you know , malicious done , because , you know , looking back - - he ' s been had this shaking thing going on
ed yeah .
james for quite some time .
and i agree that the surroundings could n ' t have helped .
ed right .
james yeah , it , it could ' ve only ex ##ace ##rba ##ted , uh , his situation .
because for - - for a good little while now i ' ve noticed , you know , that his lips would tremble , and
ed yeah .
james and , you know , it ' s like , um , uh , almost like he had , uh , what is that , parkinson ' s ?
ed yeah .
james uh , something like that , but , uh , i do n ' t know what the exact conditions were - - in that compound , but they could n ' t have been could n ' t have been , ah , con ##du ##ci ##ve to someone of his age - - and of his health - - and as far as , as , ah , the united states sending a senior ~ us official , i think they should ' ve sent someone - - i do n ' t know how senior that person had to be .
but , uh , it could ' ve been a gesture
ed well they did - - they did send somebody , i thought .
did n ' t they go with a senior official , i had
james to
ed did n ' t think they were going to ask this question , but i
james oh y - yeah , you ' re right , they did send someone .
ed but it was n ' t - - like , ah , was n ' t bush , i definitely would n ' t send him , i do n ' t think you want to have him in that part of the world right now .
james right .
no .
no .
no , i do n ' t think
ed regardless of what you think about him , he ' s , ah
james yeah , i do n ' t think he should have went - - as a matter of fact , i do n ' t think any senior official should ' ve went , i do n ' t think - - secretary of state colin powell should have went .
uh , whoever they sent was , was good enough .
ed yeah .
james yeah , was good enough , just to show - - the palestinian people - - that , uh you know , america does care somewhat - - that you ' ve lost your leader . but , uh , no , it would ' ve been - - it would ' ve been a wr ##o - as a matter of fact , i think sending bush would have made it worse .
you know .
uh , because he ' s not liked that much by the palestinian people .
so i , i do n ' t think sending him would ' ve been - - would ' ve been the right thing to do .
ed no , i agree with that .
james yeah , i do n ' t think it would ' ve added anything to - - to the situation . and possibly could ' ve made it worse .
ed yeah .
james yeah .
ed as to - - his burial
james m ##hm .
ed ah , not anymore , these are all , uh like these are all political responses
james huh .
right .
ed you know , there is no right answer , considering that that is not
james m ##hm .
ed you know , they ' re still arguing over - - that land , and is it , ah
james yeah .
ed who owns it and respect , so i mean it ' s
james m ##hm .
i ' d say my overall opinion is that - - this conflict is way past that time .
ed yeah , well ,
james you know , it ' s been going on for all these many - - what ,
ed hundreds .
james hundreds of years - - and a lot of people have lost their lives , and and a lot of kids have grown up and all they ' ve ever known - - on both sides israeli and palestinian , all they ' ve ever known is war .
and it ' s just tires ##ome .
i mean , that ' s , that ' s my , my view , this thing has gone so long - - like you said , about a piece of land .
and it ' s just , you know , they , they , they got to learn at some point - - that they ' re going to have to be able to get along .
or this is just going to keep going around , and around , and around , and , you know , the the - - the palestinians will , will , will - - will - - will do something , then israel will respond , and then back and forth - - and it ' s just like a never ending circle .
ed oh yeah .
james it ' s like a never ending circle of violence and death and destruction . and , like i said , i ' m personally just tired of it .
i think the world is just tired of it .
ed oh yeah .
james you know .
and they need to try and , try and , i , i mean , i do n ' t have the answer .
you know , i do n ' t have all the answers .
i just know that it is just - - just an ongoing situation that is - there seems to be - - no end in sight .

paul nice to meet you , mike .
mike yeah , nice to meet you .
paul uh , well , pretty complicated - - topic .
mike yeah , interesting issue .
i do n ' t know .
what do you think ?
you think it was poison ?
paul well - - ( ( sm ##oo ##sh ) ) no , i i heard that just a couple of days ago and - - i i kind of doubt it or at least i hope not .
i guess that ' s what it is .
mike yeah , i do n ' t think he was poisoned .
i think he was just fr - frail and i think he ' d been uh , he ' d been looking frail and he was shaky .
paul yeah .
mike you know , he ' d been looking h - like he was shaking and , uh , seeming frail .
for some time when i ' d see him in public , uh ,
paul yeah , that ' s true .
mike presentation - - so forth .
paul right .
mike and i think it whatever it was , it got him , just caught up with him and and he reached the you know , the end of his time .
paul yeah .
mike so , that ' s about it on that , i guess .
paul yeah .
well , i i guess now that that he ' s he ' s died - - it ' ll be , uh , or it it should be a change for the ~ pl ##o
mike well , yeah , it ' ll be change .
i i do n ' t know if it ' ll move forward any better - - but , uh , this , uh , i ' ve heard our administration thinks it will .
i think he was a block to the peace - - but i think it ' s not only his doing , it ' s also the - - you know , the , uh , more , uh , drastic elements of the ~ pl ##o that , uh , that , uh , would n ' t allow him to pursue peace
paul right .
mike at any cost .
paul well , i ' m - - i ' m - - i do n ' t know , uh .
he he seems like a guy who is much more comfortable - - being under siege than in negotiating peace settlements .
mike uh - huh .
paul um , i
mike yeah .
paul maybe that
mike well , you know , he was kind of damned if he did and damned if he did n ' t .
paul yeah .
well
mike you know , if he if he made peace he had factions of his own people that would ' ve killed him - - and if he did n ' t make peace , eh , then he ' s considered , you know , the the warm ##ong ##ering , uh , man who wo n ' t make peace , you know .
so , he , uh , he could n ' t really win .
i do n ' t think he could make peace .
i do n ' t know if anyone else can , either .
paul yeah , i guess that ' s the big question , if someone moderate takes over and they reach a settlement , does that mean the ~ pl ##o will split ?
i mean that - - that could be just - - dangerous .
mike yeah .
paul i guess , uh , making peace with half of the palestinians is better than nothing .
mike one of the other questions it asked us was , did we think our president and our , uh , you know , officials should ' ve attended his funeral .
paul ( ( oh , i b - ) )
mike what do you think about that ?
paul yeah .
well , i i do n ' t remember who they sent , but they did send over some very - - low level state department person
mike oh , i see .
paul and , uh ,
mike i did n ' t know that .
paul i i - - i was kind of embarrassed about that .
mike that we did or d - that we did not send our officials .
paul i mean - - we - - we did , but i - it was some - - it was a nobody , basically .
mike so you were embarrassed because you thought they should ' ve sent someone higher up ?
paul yeah .
mike oh , i see .
paul i i - - i mean , for for the funeral ceremony in , uh , egypt .
( ( i mean ) )
mike yeah , i think so , too .
i think they should ' ve sent someone higher up .
paul and , uh , i i can understand that they would n ' t want to send anybody
mike ( ( that he ) ) - - do n ' t forget this was the this was the representative of a whole people , you know what i mean ?
paul yeah .
mike the past he was their main representative and , uh , just out of respect for the people we should ' ve sent someone i think .
paul hm .
bad bad or good .
yeah , i think it would ' ve been a much more positive message .
mike yeah .
paul ( ( we realized that ) )
mike i think it would ' ve , uh , you know , been a - - a step toward , um , you know , gaining the , uh , i do n ' t know , the respect and and the , um ,
paul right .
yeah , i think that
mike uh , th - of the people that we ' re going to have to be working with to try to bring about a peace , you know .
paul that ( ( yeah , ) ) it - - yeah .
mike and , uh , it would ' ve - - gone an - a little farther to encourage them to , you know , be willing to sit down at the table with us , at least , you know .
paul that ' s true .
mike and , i mean not that it would ' ve even been noticed - - in that regard had he - - had had our president or someone higher gone , but the fact that they did n ' t , that ' s what ' s really going to be noticed , you know what i mean ?
paul yeah .
well , uh , you know , colin powell is a - - pretty moderate guy and would ' ve been nice to see him there or maybe - - the , uh , deputy - - secret of state .
mike uh - huh .
paul i ' m not even sure who that is .
eh , somebody will - - or higher up .
mike yeah , someone m - a little more , uh
paul some flu ##nk ##y bureau ##crat .
mike yeah .
yeah , it did n ' t seem quite appropriate .
paul but , uh , at at least for the ceremony in egypt i think , uh , i can understand that no one would want to go into - - palestinian territory .
i mean , they it was total chaos there .

mike how about you start .
marco yeah , okay , um , ( ( lot of question ) ) - - and , um , i - i do n ' t think it was poisoning , even though i have n ' t read - - a lot of articles about it .
i think -
mike he - he was old .
i mean -
marco y - he was old , yeah .
and - - - and that - i - i did n ' t realize he was n ' t allowed to be buried in jerusalem , which -
mike yeah , but a lot of that has to do with things that he ' s done .
marco yeah .
mike he ' s - i mean , like , you know , let ' s - i - - - for - for all he did in his later years , eh , ya ##sser ara ##fat was responsible for - - a good chunk of al - you know , a lot of - - israeli dying - - i - you know .
he basically , eh , i - i ' m completely torn on the whole thing .
i mean , on one hand - - i think it was kind of wrong that - - that - - you know , the ~ un just kind of went in and said , hey , you know , guess what ?
you know , we ' re - we ' re you know , this is israel now , state of israel .
and basically what they did was they carved up the region and - - - without any regard to , you know , tribal - - an ##imo ##sity really , is really what it boil ##s down to ,
marco uh - huh .
uh - huh .
mike um .
you know , then it th - it was there , he had to try to maintain the status quo - - but they bred - - people like ya ##sser ara ##fat , i mean , if it - - if it was n ' t for the stupidity of the united nations , people like ya ##sser ya ##ra - ara ##fat w - probably would ' ve never even gotten off the ground , you know .
marco how how did the united nations , uh , ara ##fat in power , or help ?
mike well , in other words eh , in other - - when - - after world war two when they when - - basically the state of israel was formed
marco m ##hm .
mike in f - uh , nineteen forty eight , i think it was .
marco yeah .
mike um , you know , you - e - - - granted , you know , there were there were jewish people already living there , but - - all the jewish people started going there and they j - basically just - you know , they just took over .
and - and
marco yeah .
mike in in a region where , uh , you know , y - you know , we live in america . it ' s like coup - you know , f - our country ' s a couple hundred years old , we got a couple of grip ##es going back to , you know , what , seventeen seventy six ,
marco yeah .
mike there it goes , you know , thou ##s - it ' s like the hatfield ##s and the mccoy ##s .
they ' re fi - they do n ' t even know why they ' re fighting anymore . they just they hate each other - - and they ' re always going to hate each other - - and it does n ' t matter who started it , but - - i - you know , somebody eh , th - somebody ' s in always intent on winning .
and it ' s and it ' s it ' s you know , a war of at ##tri ##tion .
nobody wins .
it ' s either , you know , you may kill me , but i ' m going to kill all of you before - y - you know what i mean ?
it ' s just i - i - it ' s stupid .
the whole thing ' s stupid .
and a guy like ya ##sser ara ##fat ,
marco yeah .
yeah .
mike he was a terrorist .
in in the sixties - - in the mid sixties an - and and a - you know , on into - - - you know , through the mid eighties - - the guy was a terrorist .
marco so , let us let us not forget that when israel was - - formed - - and they were , um , the - - the israelis for not feeling - - like they had a legitimate - - right - - some of the land or that - - land was n ' t , um , rightful ##ly theirs .
there were - - two very strong - - militant groups that were israeli and they - - committed a lot of terrorist acts ,
mike oh , the yeah , the zionist ##s .
abs ##o - absolutely .
marco much - - yeah .
so , i mean , i - - - you know , uh , how we consider - - ara ##fat a terrorist , we also should consider that - - could ' ve been , in some ways , a reaction to some of the terrorism that was - - initially - - committed by the israelis .
mike absolutely .
i ' m not believe me , i ' m not i ' m not ex ##cus ##ing - - anybody - - but for the purpose i i mean , the way i see it is you know , i guess for the purposes of the conversation th - - - that they want to hear ,
marco yeah .
mike y - you got to kind of have to put that as y - - - i - it ' s kind of like - - do if that ' s the case , do two wrong ##s really make a right ?
you know what i mean ?
marco but if ara ##fat had n ' t been i do n ' t know if he ' s - - directly - - been linked to hamas ' acts , uh , but he was put in a - - pretty - - sticky situation having to negotiate - - the militants of - - palestine - - the international leaders - - and if it if hara - ara ##fat had n ' t - - somehow app ##eased - - the hamas groups or the palestinian militants , then - - he would ' ve been kicked out , overthrow ##n - - by - - - by the palestinians .
mike oh , forget about kicked out or overthrow ##n , he would ' ve been killed . that ' s - that ' s how it works over there .
marco yeah .
yeah .
exactly .
well , it it ' s not really ara ##fat - - as an individual , i think it ' s just - - whatever leader - - is - - placed in the position of -
mike he was he was basically - - i mean , i ' ve read i ' ve read articles an - and - and - and - - stories that basically have linked him to the to the to the munich - - massacre - - th - you know , the munich olympic massacre th - the is - the israeli team .
it - - - the the problem is - - what he did - - back way back when
marco uh - huh .
mike will - - f - forever tar ##nish anything that he did - - in his later years . like like you said , bringing the groups together but the reason that he was able to bring them together is because he was once one of them .

joe all right .
james ( ( i ' m sorry . ) )
joe so , uh , what do you think about ara ##fat ?
james well - - i , uh , i do n ' t think there was anything malicious , uh , in terms of his death - - uh , just looking at him these last , uh , couple of years uh , it seems like he had alzheimer ' s or something .
joe yeah , he has been getting older .
james yeah , because he was quivering at the mouth and and hands were shaking .
and - - i would imagine that living in that compound could n ' t have been that con ##du ##ci ##ve to his health .
joe yeah , he probably should have been in a hospital or a hospice or
james right .
joe you know , if it was that bad .
james right .
right , i ' m sure that they , i do n ' t know about , bout - - the uh sanitary conditions there , but - - i i just do n ' t think it could have been , uh , con ##du ##ci ##ve to his health .
and as far as , uh , israel , uh , allowing - - him to be buried - - uh , in jerusalem
joe that ' s accept
james huh ?
joe that ' s acceptable to me .
i mean
james well , it , it ' s acceptable to me , but i do n ' t think it was feasible .
joe feasible
james yeah , given the circumstance in that area right now .
i do n ' t even know if they would have been able to pull it off , you know ?
joe well , uh , so he , in fact he was n ' t
james pardon me ?
joe so , um - - no , so he was n ' t buried in jerusalem .
james no .
no , they buried him - - uh , inside that compound .
joe oh , i see .
james yeah , they buried him inside that compound .
but like you say , i do n ' t , i do n ' t - - i personally - - uh - - would n ' t have seen a problem with it , but - - i just do n ' t think it was feasible .
i do n ' t , i do n ' t think that they would have been - - uh , secure enough to really do it .
i do n ' t think either side would have really - - let it happen - - and - - and as far as a senior u . s . official going , i do n ' t think that would have been necessary either .
um , i know president bush should n ' t have went - - and he was n ' t going .
joe well , i kind of feel , i kind of feel another way .
i think a senior u . s . service in there , should have been there , because i mean - - he , ara ##fat ' s been - - been the one coming to all these peace talks , you know , with president clinton and , you know , other
james m ##hm .
joe other um - - litigation ##s towards that .
james m ##hm .
joe you know , i think , i think we could have just showed our face and said you know , yeah , we do recognize this man .
james m ##hm .
well it , they sent someone .
i do n ' t know who it was - - ( ( it was n ' t ) )
joe it probably , it was n ' t anybody important .
it was just like a
james yeah it was an under secretary , there ' s no doubt about it .
there was no senior
joe
james there was no senior u . s . official there .
there ' s there ' s no question about that .
joe yeah .
james but , uh - - you know , uh , bush ' s policy - - towards , uh , ya ##sser ara ##fat has been hands off
joe yeah .
james from from the beginning cause i do n ' t , i do n ' t think he ever even met with him .
did he ?
joe i do n ' t think so .
i do n ' t think so .
james yeah , i i
joe bush is kind of like , staying away from the whole israel - - palestinian
james m ##hm .
now on his part i think that was a mistake .
joe yeah .
james yeah , you know you got to engage people in some type of dialogue
joe and
james if you
joe to me , the talk , the peace talks should have continued - - after clinton ' s administration left .
james true .
joe cause at the cause at the end clinton was doing all this peace talk with ara ##fat and , um
james true .
m ##hm .
joe ( ( forget ) ) the um , prime minister in israel , but he was talking to him .
james uh , sharon .
joe sharon , yeah .
james yeah .
m ##hm .
joe they were doing all these talks in camp david and and it should have just continued when br - bush came into office .
james you ' re absolutely right .
i agree .
like i said , i think that was one of bush ' s biggest mistakes ,
joe m ##hm .
james not continuing - - the talks .
because clinton had came so very close
joe yes .
james to to maybe getting some type of agreement
joe no .
james but , uh , bush just took a hands off approach .
he just - - kind of took a hands off approach .
joe and now the situation in , you know , jerusalem and the west bank is just - - escalated .
james absolutely .
and i think too - - israel ' s - - position toward ara ##fat - - in terms of keeping him sort of like - - uh - - surrounded in that compound - - i do n ' t think that was a good idea .
joe no .
james you know , because that , you ca n ' t pick a leader for a people .
whether you like them or not - - people get to choose who they want to follow ,
joe exactly .
james and the palestinians had made it clear - - that ara ##fat was their leader .
joe exactly .
james so , i think that they , we should have found a way - - israel should have found a way - - to - - keep some type of dialogue - - going along .
cause uh , i mean , you look at what ' s going on now .
joe m ##hm .
james i mean , their policy toward him did n ' t get them anything .
and then you got suicide bombing on the one side , and then you got israel - - you know , it ' s like one day , you ' ll he - a bomb will go off , the next day israel will do and air strike and - - you know , it ' s like going around in a circle .
joe yeah .
james it ' s like going around in a circle .
joe it ' s really a bad situation .
james it is .
it is , and it ' s , it ' s been so long - - going on , i mean , you ' re talking about something that ' s been going on historically for hundreds of years .
joe hundreds of years and then , it just recently really come into spectrum ,
james m ##hm .

are there people you see during the holidays that you do n ' t see during the rest of the year ?
do you travel to meet up with family or friends during the holidays ?
where do you go and who do you visit ?
ed hi this is ed .
good .
how are you doing jane ?
if you hear noise in the background , i ' m enjoying the holiday season walking in new york city , so
jane oh , okay .
ed ( ( city ) ) - - ( ( trusts of life ) ) - - crazy people and , uh , other things going on but that ' s new york , what can you say .
jane yeah yeah yeah .
used to live in new york .
my brother - in - law still lives in the city but we were long island people .
ed yeah .
uh , so what are you doing for the fest ##ive holidays .
jane you know , it ' s really bad because i still really do n ' t know .
i ' m up in the air with about six different clients trying to decide what we ' re going to do .
ed ( ( allan ) ) - - well , that ' s not bad .
that means that you ' ve got a lot of people to see and do things with .
that ' s good .
jane yeah , makes it kind of he ##ctic .
how about you ?
what are you doing ?
ed ah , family .
jane ac ##h .
ed yeah .
yeah , we ' re going to be doing , uh , the typical .
go up and celebrate with the family and - - be with the little kids .
you know , the ( ( tough years ) ) and that which makes it - - because when you get older it ' s kind of , i ' ve got all the gifts , i do n ' t need that .
what i really want to do is see somebody else enjoy it and the little kids enjoy it .
so - - - and , uh , do a lot of parties with family - - and friends .
jane well , that ' s kind of where - we ' re in between which family we ' re going to see and when and how and get all that worked out .
ed uh ,
jane
ed so who ##ev - yeah , i ' ve seen them - - - just not the gifts it comes down to the food .
see , now you ( ( ) ) .
jane there you go .
i - one of these choices is meat cooking .
we ' ll have to put that towards the end .
ed ( ( ah , ou ##i . ) ) - - eh , ( ( nice ) ) .
so we - we ' ve only -
jane
ed my family ' s , uh , parents are deceased and most of ( ( them ) ) is , uh , passed my brothers all over , so her family ' s still younger - - and , uh , you know , just the odd sides .
she ' s the oldest and i ' m the youngest , so she ' s got younger which - - keeps the thing going , so i - - - you know , my view is - - ( ( stay ) ) with the family go visit the family .
that ' s all you got .
so - - keep it together through thick and thin and - - when it comes to thanksgiving we go up there and we celebrate .
and then there ' s little parties .
big - uh , her sister does a big family party - - but try to keep that same
jane
ed local family coming together .
it ' s amazing how they can get into little sq ##ua ##bble ##s and who does n ' t show up
jane of course .
ed like that .
i think it ' s crazy .
so , ( ( so , uh ) ) -
jane they used to always really all get together .
but his parents uh they actually live next door to us .
but they ' re starting to get up in the years , so they ' re not , you know , hosting the big parties , so it ' s funny how now people do n ' t all bother to come
ed yeah .
jane and you kind of wonder you know in the next couple of years what ' s all going to happen .
are they all going to see each other .
ed yeah , no that ' s - that ' s exactly .
i ' ve already seen , you know , ( ( in ) ) my parents ( ( ' bed ) ) until they ( ( got ) ) less and less that the brothers got together - - and then now when there ' s an event you try to do it .
at christmas it ' s just impossible because we leave - - two days after christmas
jane m ##hm .
ed to go out of the country as part of our new year ' s
jane
ed celebration .
so , for us it ' s , you know , got to be a quick trip up
jane
ed to her family and then back where we - - - we ' ve been invited to be down in
jane
ed another country .
if a person is not - even though it ' s cold up in the northeast , it ' s a family tradition .
i should do it - - and less for the gifts and more for
jane
ed being together .
yeah .
jane well , we did - - - - for the kids you know we made it pretty cl -
ed i do n ' t know , i think that ' s great .
jane - you know , you did n ' t have all the has ##sle of running around and being crazy and just kind of spent time together
ed and i think that ' s very - i mean , if -
jane and it was really pretty nice .
ed yeah , we haven ' t - - - yeah , i think - - e - e - eventually that may happen , the way we ' re going with , uh ,
jane
ed my wife and i with her
jane
ed family .
not as a negative but as a -
jane
ed you know , we do a lot of traveling so that ' s going to be - i think that ' s going to come up .
jane
ed but - - - but for now we ' re still trying to do -
jane
ed as long as the mother ' s around , we ' ll still do christmas and act as -
jane
ed she is not really old , but she ' s getting older , so i think that ' s one reason to stay together
jane
ed and also i think i - is
jane
ed eh , we - we kind of - - infused a little family party that her sister has so - - i think if we were to go away both of those might fall off a little bit and it does n ' t take but one year and then all of the sudden everybody ' s
jane yeah .
ed not coming to it anymore and it ' s like a -
jane that ' s it .
that ' s the way it is .
ed yeah , but not because -
jane if i ' m no -
ed it is - - - i - i enjoy the - - smiling people and the fest ##ive - - - fest ##ive nature and - - i think it does get a little commercial ##ized .
( ( it ' s not that the - ) ) - - you can ignore that part of it , i guess .

dei ##rd ##re yeah , that ' s what we do .
every year , uh , but i do n ' t always attend . uh , my family - - celebrates the sun shining .
they ' re always together . so , uh , it ' s not particularly special at christmas - - because they see each other every other weekend .
but , still , uh , they go to , uh , grandmother ' s - - every christmas .
a particular person ' s house every holiday season .
you know , whether it ' s christmas or - - thanksgiving or mother ' s day or easter , it just alternate ##s it - you know , each - uh , a particular person ' s house is - is how they do it .
ryan oh .
dei ##rd ##re i just do n ' t always attend .
just - - - i do n ' t know , it ' s - - - there ' s just so much of my family i can take during one year , you know , but -
ryan well , um , since they see each other so much , is there anything that does make it special ?
dei ##rd ##re well , i guess they seem to think it ' s just special because - - everyone comes .
i - i - it ' s - - - it ' s just , i do n ' t know , old .
y - you know , it ' s - it ' s not - - - it ' s not special to me because they do it all the time .
you know , special would make it , i only see you once a year .
it ' s just not - it ' s just not special if i see you every other month .
ryan yeah .
dei ##rd ##re you know , it ' s just not .
i mean , you know , not like , you ' re seeing your mother - - or your sister , maybe your brothers , you know , you - you might - you may see them all the time , but when you see your aunt ##s and uncles and all your cousins - - all the time , where ' s the break here ? but , you know , they like - i do n ' t particularly care for it , but they like it .
i did attend thanksgiving and
ryan huh .
dei ##rd ##re that was nice .
um , uh , it was - it was a good day .
uh , but , you know , we - we - - spend all day together .
it ' s not like you just go and eat dinner a couple of hours and go home .
you go and you stay twelve hours - - because most of my relatives live within thirty minutes of each other ,
ryan ( ( ye - ) )
dei ##rd ##re so it ' s easy .
ryan oh , wow .
dei ##rd ##re yeah .
it ' s easy just to go to someone ' s house .
ryan well , sounds a lot like my mom ' s side of the family because they ' re all in one city except for
dei ##rd ##re and -
ryan except for her and , uh , us .
dei ##rd ##re well , would you rather be with everyone else or do you like it - - away .
ryan i think i would rather be , but then again - - i talk to my cousin and i ' m always asking her how my other cousins are doing and - - she hardly knows because she has - hardly sees them every day .
dei ##rd ##re oh .
ryan so i do n ' t think it ' d make a big difference .
dei ##rd ##re for you , yeah , well .
i do n ' t ( ( see them or - ) ) you know , by choice and , you know , relatives - - are particular people , you know , but not particular , peculiar people , let ' s put it that way .
it ' s just - - funny to me who you end up with , you know ,
ryan yeah .
dei ##rd ##re as your relative , you know .
you think , eh , you are my re ##la - you got to be kidding me .
w ##h - - - what happened here but , uh , it ' s fun , uh .
now , i ' m not so big on christi - i mean , i was - i was raised christian , uh , but , uh , and i did n ' t put too much , you know , in my house with my kids - - but my da ##ught - , she ' s just - - you know , she get ' s into it .
she ' s really sentimental .
she ' s gets into the holiday spirit and wants every light , you know , in the city on our house and , you know , tree in her room , that kind of thing .
ryan yeah .
dei ##rd ##re you know , i - i ind ##ul ##ge her , you know .
but i do n ' t really get too much into it .
you know , the - - - all the , um , trim ##ming ##s , i suppose , of the holiday season .
uh , but i like , you know , gift giving and - - just , uh , sharing things and just having fun .
just , uh , just do n ' t over do it . but i would prefer , though , um , a service , a spiritual service - - to uh , family ' s just always together , they ' re always together .
now if there was a spiritual service then , yeah , see that would be really special to me .
if everybody - now w ##h - eh , eh , now years ago , and of course i ' m not giving away my age but trust me , i ' m older ,

i - - - eh , i just - - i - i think the situation could be handled better .
i - i thought it was a great idea fir - them going in there - - and doing what they did but , uh , they had a short window of opportunity to win over the people and it did n ' t happen .

first relief convoy arrives in iraq as allies struggle to clear the way
umm q ##as ##r , iraq ( ap )
the first sizable relief convoy arrived in iraq during a sands ##torm wednesday as allied forces struggled to clear the way for more aid shipments , using dolphins to remove mines from waterways and hunting iraqi fighters around the port of umm q ##as ##r .
three days after u . s . president george w . bush promised ` ` massive amounts ' ' of humanitarian aid , seven large , battered tractor - trailers arrived in umm q ##as ##r carrying food and water donated by kuwait ##is .
the convoy was escorted by u . s . soldiers .
` ` we planned for 30 trucks but we only got seven loaded because of the severe sands ##torm , ' ' said e . j . russell of the humanitarian operations center , a joint u . s . - kuwait ##i agency .
the storm cut visibility to about 100 yards ( 91 meters ) .
hundreds of cases of water were stacked on three of the trucks .
the rest carried boxes of tuna , crack ##ers , sweets and other food .
as the trucks lumber ##ed past blasted buildings on the iraq - kuwait border , an iraqi boy of about 10 pointed to his mouth and shouted ` ` eat , eat ! ' '
people lined up along the streets , giving thumbs - up signs to the aid convoy as it rolled by and begging for food and cigarettes .
after days of fierce fighting that shut down the city of umm q ##as ##r , iraqi youths cheered and swarm ##ed british troops as they handed out yellow meal packets and bottles of water wednesday .
the troops , already in the city , were not part of the aid convoy .
` ` umm q ##as ##r is now secure _ as a port and as a town , ' ' said brig . jim dutton of the royal marines .
the town ' s deep ##water port , the only one in iraq , is essential for any relief effort .
plans to bring supplies to iraqi civilians had been on hold for days because of fighting across southern iraq .
on tuesday , u . n . secretary - general ko ##fi anna ##n warned u . s . national security adviser condo ##lee ##zza rice that the united states is legally responsible for providing relief aid .
white house spokesman ari fl ##eis ##cher blamed saddam hussein ' s regime for slowing the flow of us $ 105 million in u . s . aid by placing mines in the port of umm q ##as ##r .
u . s . navy helicopters flew two dolphins _ ma ##kai and tacoma _ into umm q ##as ##r , where they were to begin fe ##rret ##ing out mines wednesday .
royal marine commandos carried out an overnight sweep around the port , searching for iraqi hold ##outs .
the british said they had enough control over the area to begin sending in ships .
a british ship , the sir gala ##had , moved into position at the mouth of the k ##hor abd ##alla ##h river tuesday night with 211 tons of food and 101 tons of bottled water .
it was to begin the six - hour journey into umm q ##as ##r on wednesday , according to a pool report .
iraqi ##s have about five weeks of food left , according to estimates by the world food program .
about 13 million people
_
60 percent of iraq ' s 22 million _ are completely dependent on food hand ##outs ,
the world food program , a u . n . agency , said it would make its biggest single request for cash in its history _ more than us $ 1 billion to help feed the war - stricken nation for about six months .
` ` this could well turn into the largest humanitarian operation in history , ' ' said agency spokesman trevor rowe .
before the war , iraqi ##s depended on government rations distributed under the u . n . ' s oil - for - food program .
the 7 - year - old program allows iraq to sell unlimited quantities of oil to buy food , medicine and other humanitarian goods .
the proceeds from oil sales are deposited in a u . n . - controlled es ##crow account .
the war has thrown the future of that program in doubt .
because the united states and britain failed to get u . n . backing for the war , russia , france , germany and china want to ensure that the immediate humanitarian costs of the war are paid by the united states
_ and not the united nations .
anna ##n wants to revive the u . n . aid program as quickly as possible .
a resolution giving him authority to run the program for 45 days is stalled because russia , syria and others are insisting the united nations must not san ##ction the war or give the united states control over the u . n . - controlled account , which holds billions of dollars .
iraqi trade minister mohammed me ##hdi sale ##h accused the united states and britain of causing the hardship ##s by launching the war and disrupt ##ing shipments of supplies under the oil - for - food program .
he claimed , though , that iraq can fen ##d for itself : ` ` iraq does not need any humanitarian assistance .
we are a rich country . ' '

u . s . para ##tro ##opers parachute into northern iraq , secure airfield , link up with kurdish militia
ir ##bil , iraq ( ap )
kurdish militia ##men and u . s . special operations troops linked up with more than 1 , 000 u . s . army para ##tro ##opers thursday to secure the area around a strategic air strip , as the first large coalition ground force in northern iraq began opening another front against saddam hussein ' s regime .
the army ' s 173 ##rd airborne brigade , including elite army rangers , jumped out of low - flying c - 17 transport planes under cover of darkness wednesday and secured a snow - dust ##ed airfield , which will be used to bring in supplies and support personnel .
the air ##drop - one of the biggest para ##tro ##op drops in decades - was a dramatic entry for ground troops into a region where only small groups of u . s . special forces have been operating .
coalition airs ##tri ##kes have been hitting iraqi military forces and other strategic targets in the north .
` ` this tighten ##s the no ##ose against saddam ' s forces battling coalition forces to the south , ' ' brig . gen . james parker , commander of u . s . forces in the north .
` ` and it may also serve as a warning to turkish forces . ' '
giving cover for the deployment , u . s . warp ##lane ##s struck iraqi ground troops and bunker ##s in northern iraq .
three waves of combat planes from the aircraft carrier uss theodore roosevelt hit ` ` ground troops , command and control bunker ##s , artillery positions and . . . a surface to air missile battery , ' ' said lt . john oliveira , the ship ' s public affair officer .
around dawn thursday , strikes resumed , with a massive explosion just outside the kurdish zone close to the village of kala ##k .
warp ##lane ##s pounded forward iraqi positions in the hills overlooking cha ##mc ##ham ##al , 35 kilometers ( 22 miles ) east of the key oil city of kirk ##uk .
later thursday , kurdish troops in cha ##mc ##ham ##al advanced their positions between government - controlled and rebel - controlled areas , taking over a iraqi check point on their front with no fighting at this point , witnesses said .
early thursday , kurdish fighters closed off a highway and roads near the airs ##trip where troops were said to be arriving , outside the town of bash ##ur , about 30 miles ( 50 kilometers ) northeast of the ku ##rd - controlled city of ir ##bil and 30 miles ( 50 kilometers ) south of the turkish border .
from the highway , dust ##ed from a recent snow , a flashing light from the airs ##trip ' s control tower was visible in the distance , and three helicopters could be seen landing , flying with nearly all their lights extinguished .
future airlift ##s into the area will include supplies and support personnel for the 173 ##rd ' s fighters , defense officials said .
the airfield ' s 6 , 700 - foot ( 2 , 04 ##2 - meter ) runway is long enough to land c - 17 ##s and other u . s . military cargo planes .
lt . col . thomas collins , a spokesman for the u . s . army ' s southern european task force , refused to say whether the para ##tro ##opers deployed directly from italy into iraq or had taken a different route .
the matter immediately sparked controversy in italy , where there is a strong anti - war movement .
the country ' s parliament voted this month to allow u . s . - led coalition forces to use italian air space and military bases - but not for directs attacks on iraq .
pentagon officials have said for weeks they would have u . s . forces in northern iraq to open another front against saddam ' s forces .
the vast majority of the coalition ground troops in iraq are moving toward baghdad from the south after entering from kuwait .
pentagon officials had hoped to have the army ' s 4th infantry division invade iraq from the north , but turkey bal ##ked at allowing up to 62 , 000 u . s . troops on its soil to prepare for that option .
the use of the 173 ##rd shows the military has shifted to a smaller , lighter force .
military officials say they would have liked to have secured key oil fields around the northern cities of mo ##sul and kirk ##uk - and perhaps the cities themselves - by now .
though no hostilities were expected during the deployment , the 173 ##rd decided to parachute in rather then ferry troops in by plane so that a significant combat force could mass almost immediately to protect itself , officers said , according to a u . s . reporter traveling with the 173 ##rd .
` ` kirk ##uk is key .
the iraqi ' s want it , the ku ##rds want it , the turks want it and various other ethnic groups also want it , ' '
maj . mike hastings said .
` ` what this drop means is that we can secure it until we are relieved by other forces . ' '
besides mo ##sul and kirk ##uk , another key target in northern iraq is ti ##kr ##it , saddam ' s hometown and the tribal center for most of his inner circle .
most of the ad ##nan division of the republican guard relocated from the mo ##sul area to the ti ##kr ##it area shortly before the war began .
another key mission for the 173 ##rd could be to keep order in northern iraq , which is controlled by two semi - autonomous kurdish factions but also includes several splinter groups and a base for the al - q ##aid ##a - linked an ##sar al - islam .
turkey has said it may send more troops into northern iraq to prevent refugees from moving north , while u . s . officials have said they advised turkey against sending large additional forces into northern iraq .

u . s . troops push toward baghdad ' s southern outskirts ; capital plunged into darkness after explosions
south of baghdad , iraq ( ap )
u . s . soldiers moved to capture baghdad ' s saddam international airport early friday and fought running battles with iraqi defenders along the city ' s southern fringe ##s .
` ` a vis ##e is closing on the regime , ' ' u . s . president george w . bush said .
some front ##line units went on heightened alert against the threat of chemical weapons , ordered to wear rubber boots and suits despite temperatures that soared into the 90s .
there was fierce fighting in ku ##t , to the south of baghdad , where desperate iraqi ##s armed with rifles charged tanks in a suicide raid . ` ` we mo ##wed down ' ' the attackers , said lt . col . b . p . mccoy .
despite declaration ##s that more tough fighting lies ahead , the top u . s . military official indicated there may not be an all - out battle for baghdad .
gen . richard myers , chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , suggested iso ##lating members of the old regime in the capital _ cut off from the rest of the country _ while an ` ` interim administration ' ' is put in place to begin work on a postwar government .
a meeting to organize an interim government could be held in iraq within a week , a senior pentagon official said thursday night .
for the first time in the war , large parts of baghdad lost electricity .
the cause was not known .
myers told reporters at a pentagon briefing that americans had not targeted the power grid .
trace ##r rounds lit the night sky and artillery boomed near the airport a few kilometers ( miles ) from the heart of president saddam hussein ' s capital of 5 million people .
at one stage , it appeared that u . s . forces had taken control of the airport , ` ` and then it got more confusing with continued fighting , myers said thursday night .
capture of the airport would give american and british troops a facility for airlift ##ing equipment and troops to baghdad .
along the city ' s southern edge , u . s . tanks and bradley vehicles destroyed at least seven iraqi armored personnel carriers and more than 15 iraqi tanks in fighting that went on for more than four hours .
two weeks into the war , american commanders reported a string of successes _ on the battlefield and within an iraqi population initially reluctant about embracing invading troops .
kurdish fighters in the north chip ##ped in , when a top leader suggested they may agree not to seek control of the northern city of kirk ##uk .
there were battlefield set ##backs , as well .
two marines were killed and one injured in the close - quarters fighting in ku ##t .
and an army soldier investigating a destroyed tank in central iraq was killed by friendly fire when he was mistaken for an iraqi , the military said .
u . s . defense officials also were investigating whether a navy hornet jet that crashed wednesday was shot down by a u . s . patriot missile . the navy was searching for the pilot thursday .
the overall toll of american troops dead passed 50 , and bush visited a marine camp , which has lost 13 _ more than any other installation .
` ` he ' s in heaven , ' ' the commander in chief told the family of one fallen marine in a private moment .
to the cheers of thousands earlier in a speech , he vowed victory , and said , ` ` a vis ##e is closing on the regime . ' '
iraqi officials issued the latest in a series of ex ##hort ##ations in saddam ' s name .
` ` fight them with your hands .
god will disgrace them , ' ' they said , referring to invading american and british troops .
but the daily urging ##s seemed increasingly at odds with the military situation across the country , and myers said saddam had lost control of 45 percent of iraq ' s territory .
as conventional units fought their way to the outskirts of the capital , officials said special forces had raided the tha ##rth ##ar presidential palace near ti ##kr ##it , saddam ' s hometown .
documents were seized at the site north of baghdad , said brig . gen . vincent brooks at u . s . central command in the persian gulf , but no ranking members of the regime were found .
` ` that ' s all right , he added , ` ` there ' s other operations ongoing . ' '
to the far north , u . s . special forces and kurdish militia ##men captured the town of bard ##ara ##sh and a nearby bridge , one of few routes into the city of mo ##sul near government - held oil fields .
iraqi ##s had held the town for 13 years .
in the country ' s southern region , british forces penetrated closer to the center of bas ##ra , and warp ##lane ##s dropped 500 - pound ( 225 - ki ##logram ) and 1 , 000 - pound ( 450 - ki ##logram ) laser - guided bombs on an iraqi intelligence complex .
die - hard defenders have held out for days inside the city of 1 . 3 million .
american officials cited continuing examples of iraqi ##s cooper ##ating with invading troops .
in na ##ja ##f , they said a prominent cleric under house arrest by the iraqi government had urged the population not to interfere with the operations of american or british forces .
a small group of iraqi defenders has been holding out inside the city in a mosque , considered a shi ##ite holy site , and local cleric ##s said one religious leader had recently arrived in hopes of arranging for their safe passage out of the shrine .
ground forces closed in on baghdad from separate southern approaches , the army from the southeast and marines from the southwest , in advances begun tuesday night .
american and british helicopters and planes bombed positions in ku ##t , and marines and iraqi ##s lo ##bbed grenades at close quarters .
between 10 and 15 iraqi ##s armed only with rifles charged marine tanks in the suicide charge .
two u . s . marines died in the fighting _ and a med ##ic who tried to save one of them sorrow ##fully buried his res ##us ##cit ##ation equipment on the spot .
army forces rolled past dozens of dead iraqi soldiers and bombed - out hulk ##s of iraqi military equipment as they made their way toward baghdad from the area around ka ##rba ##la .
many more iraqi soldiers surrendered to the overwhelming force of the americans , and were shuttle ##d to the rear .
at the same time they worried about chemical weapons attacks , brooks disclosed that a special operations force in the southwestern desert had found a number of bottles ` ` marked in strange ways . ' '
he said an investigation was under way .

russia accepts world bank loan to combat aids , tuberculosis
moscow ( ap )
russia has accepted a us $ 150 million world bank loan to combat the spread of aids and tuberculosis , ending a negotiating process that lasted four years , world bank officials said friday .
the world bank first offered the loan in 1999 , but disagreements over treatment kept the project on hold .
russia objected to world bank rules that required monitoring of patients receiving medication , the world bank said .
but after drawn - out talks , president vladimir putin signed off on the loan , which will take effect this year , the world bank said .
` ` russia has one of the fastest growing aids epidemic ##s in the world ' ' and has a ` ` fears ##ome ' ' problem with tuberculosis , particularly drug - resistant strains , said ole ##so ##ji ad ##ey ##i , a world bank health specialist .
` ` it ' s a potential dual epidemic , ' ' he said , adding that people with immune systems weakened by the aids virus are especially vulnerable to contracting tb , which he called an ` ` op ##port ##uni ##stic disease . ' '
aids came relatively late to russia , but spread rapidly , primarily due to intra ##ven ##ous drug abuse and a lack of prevention programs . officials have registered more than 230 , 000 cases of hiv , though health experts say the actual number of hiv infections tops 1 million .
tuberculosis , meanwhile , has also emerged as a serious problem , particularly in russia ' s over ##crow ##ded prisons .

north korea says security council ' s handling of nuclear issue is ' a prelude to war '
seoul , south korea ( ap )
north korea on sunday rejected the u . n . security council ' s plan to discuss the stand ##off over its suspected nuclear weapons development , calling it ` ` a prelude to war . ' '
meanwhile , south korean officials said cabinet - level talks scheduled this week between the two korea ##s looked unlikely to take place .
seoul had hoped to use the meeting to try to persuade its communist neighbor to scrap its nuclear ambitions .
the security council is scheduled to discuss north korea ' s nuclear program on wednesday , and p ##yon ##gy ##ang has said that any sanctions imposed on it will be tan ##tam ##ount to war .
the u . n . discussions are ` ` a grave pro ##vocation act intended to sc ##ut ##tle all ( the north ' s ) effort for dialogue and ag ##gra ##vate the situation on the korean peninsula , ' ' a north korean foreign ministry spokesman was quoted as saying by state - run news agency kc ##na .
the security council ' s ` ` handling of the nuclear issue on the korean peninsula itself is precisely a prelude to war , ' ' the spokesman said .
for months , north korea has insisted on direct talks with the united states to negotiate a non ##ag ##gre ##ssion treaty .
washington has refused , saying a multi ##lateral solution to the crisis was needed .
the u . s . administration has been pressing the security council to adopt a statement condemning p ##yon ##gy ##ang for failing to meet its obligations to prevent the spread of nuclear arms .
but kc ##na quoted the spokesman as saying that the u . s . invasion of iraq showed that washington was not bound by international agreements .
a non ##ag ##gre ##ssion treaty with p ##yon ##gy ##ang would not necessarily ave ##rt war because it may not be honored , he said .
it was not immediately clear if p ##yon ##gy ##ang would drop its demand for a non ##ag ##gre ##ssion pact .
north korea also said washington is ` ` seriously mistaken ' ' if it thinks that the communist country will accept the u . s . demand to di ##sar ##m .
it said it will ignore any u . n . resolution on the nuclear issue .
if the u . n . security council cooperate ##s with u . s . efforts to ` ` st ##if ##le ' '
north korea , it would leave the north with ` ` no other option but to beef up the deter ##rent force for war by mob ##ili ##zing all the potential ##s , ' ' kc ##na quoted the foreign ministry spokesman as saying .
for weeks , north korea has claimed that the united states plans to attack it after iraq .
washington says it seeks a diplomatic end , but has not ruled out a military solution .
last year , u . s . president george w . bush said north korea was part of an ` ` axis of evil ' ' along with iraq and iran , and that it was developing weapons of mass destruction .
south korea has tried to keep a lid on rising tensions between washington and p ##yon ##gy ##ang .
but officials in seoul said sunday that north korea had yet to confirm that cabinet - level meetings scheduled to begin monday in p ##yon ##gy ##ang would go ahead .
seoul had hoped to use the three - day talks to try to persuade its communist neighbor to scrap its suspected nuclear program in return for aid and better relations with the outside world .
north korea called off two working - level talks with south korea last month .
also on sunday , south korean law ##makers said they would work to quickly set up a special parliamentary committee to deal with the north ' s nuclear issue .
the nuclear stand ##off began in october , when u . s . officials said north korea admitted having a secret nuclear program in violation of a 1994 agreement .

urgent u . s . tanks roll into heart of baghdad and troops occupy key buildings .
near baghdad ( ap )
american troops stormed a presidential palace and other key buildings in baghdad as u . s . tanks rumbled into the heart of the battered iraqi capital on monday amid the thunder of gunfire and explosions .
buildings occupied by u . s . troops included saddam hussein ' s newest presidential palace , the information ministry and the al - rashid hotel .
reporters saw the tanks roll into the heart of baghdad on the western side of the ti ##gr ##is river , which divides the city .
as u . s . columns moved northeast along the ti ##gr ##is river , iraqi ##s fled along its banks and some jumped in the water .
an ammunition depot across the river was on fire .
more than 70 tanks and 60 bradley armored vehicles were involved in the blitz , military sources said .
at the palace compound , iraqi ##s shot small arms fire from a clock tower , which the u . s . tanks quickly destroyed .
most of the compound was severely damaged from prior u . s . raids .
col . david perkins , a brigade commander of the 3rd infantry , told his troops before the operation that the mission was intended to be ` ` a dramatic show of force ' ' to demonstrate that u . s . forces can enter baghdad at any time , anywhere .
` ` i hope this makes it clear to the iraqi people that this ( the regime ) is over and that they can now enjoy their new freedom , ' ' perkins said .
` ` i do believe this city is freak ##in ' ours , ' ' said capt . chris carter .
monday ' s inc ##urs ##ion by u . s . armor was the second , but appeared to be much heavier .
the first one was on saturday and triggered intense gun battles , which according to some u . s . accounts , left at least 2 , 000 iraqi fighters dead .
since coalition troops seized baghdad ' s international airport , they have encircled the heavily - bombed city of 5 million people , blocking off entry and exits and monitored all movement from the air .
in a move weighted with symbolism and tactical importance , a hulk ##ing u . s . c - 130 transport plane flew into baghdad ' s airport .
the arrival pre ##sa ##ged a major res ##up ##ply effort by air for u . s . troops , dependent until now on a ten ##uous line stretching 550 kilometers ( 350 miles ) to kuwait .
monday ' s advances came one day after british forces in the south made their deepest push into iraq ' s second largest city .
gen . peter pace , vice chairman of the u . s . joint chiefs of staff , told cnn that u . s . forces drove though portions of the iraqi capital , seizing iraqi tanks and armored personnel carriers .
u . s . officials have declared baghdad cut off from the rest of iraq .
` ` we do control the highways in and out of the city and do have the capability to inter ##dict , to stop , to attack any iraqi military forces that might try to either escape or to engage our forces , ' ' said pace .
intense fighting over the weekend took a growing toll on combatants and civilians .
injured russian diplomats and a convoy of america ' s kurdish comrades in arms were among un ##int ##ended victims caught in cross ##fire and friendly fire sunday .
ku ##rds said 18 of their own died in the mistaken u . s . air strike .
ass ##orted prizes fell into allied hands , some after hard fighting , but u . s . forces had yet to confront baghdad ' s last - ditch defenders on a large scale .
inside a vip building at the airport , troops found a lavish hide ##away believed to have been used by saddam , associated press television news reported .
southeast of baghdad , marines seized one of saddam ' s palaces and poked through remnants of a republican guard headquarters .
also to the south , u . s . forces took control sunday of the center of the holy city of ka ##rba ##la , the army times newspaper reported from the scene .
u . s . forces consolidated positions around baghdad .
explosions were heard throughout the night sunday , and shortly before dawn on monday , shaking downtown buildings .
on another vital front , british troops thrust to the center of bas ##ra , iraq ' s second largest city , with a sense they were finally shaking saddam loyalists loose .
british desert rats went into the city of 1 . 3 million with more than three dozen tanks and armored cars , a column similar in size to the american unit that probe ##d suburban baghdad .
the british found resistance softer than expected , picked up reports that the local ba ##ath party leadership was crumbling and fought into the core , losing at least three soldiers .
` ` we have a lot of it occupied , ' ' british maj . gen . peter wall told the bbc .
he said it might take days to put down renegade ##s .
the united states is deploy ##ing some of iraq ' s exiles and internal di ##ssi ##dents around the country to help root out pro - saddam elements , keep order and distribute aid , according to one such organization , the iraq national congress .
the group said several hundred of its members were flown to an area near the city of nas ##iri ##yah .
in northern iraq , u . s . warp ##lane ##s struck a convoy of allied kurdish fighters and u . s . special forces sunday in one of the dead ##liest friendly fire attacks of the war .
at least 18 people were killed and more than 45 wounded , including senior kurdish commanders , kurdish officials said .
u . s . central command only reported one civilian killed and six people injured , including a u . s . soldier , but its investigation was not complete .
a convoy of russian diplomats , including the ambassador , came under fire sunday while eva ##cu ##ating baghdad , the russian foreign ministry said .
a correspondent for state - run russian television said the convoy was caught in a cross ##fire and three diplomats were hurt , one with a serious stomach wound .
u . s . central command said no allied forces were operating in the area at the time , but it was investigating what happened .

u . s . troops tighten grip on capital , u . s . military criticized for media casualties
baghdad , iraq ( ap )
u . s . forces tightened their grip throughout baghdad , entering the city for the first time from the north , seizing a military airport and battling sniper ##s and republican guard fighters .
meanwhile , the u . s . military faced sharp criticism over assaults that killed three foreign journalists .
pentagon officials said tuesday they did n ' t know whether iraqi president saddam hussein died in the u . s . airs ##tri ##ke on a baghdad neighborhood the day before .
the strike destroyed three nearby houses and killed at least two people .
u . s . marines battled sniper ##s as they fought deeper into the capital from the east .
they seized the rash ##eed airport and captured enough ammunition for an estimated 3 , 000 troops .
ominous ##ly , they also took a prison where they found u . s . army uniforms and chemical weapons suits possibly belonging to american pow ##s .
some army units routed iraqi fighters from a republican guard headquarters inside the capital .
others discovered a 12 - room complex inside a cave , complete with white marble floors and fluorescent lighting .
members of the u . s . army ' s v corps opened up a new front by entering baghdad from the north .
the toll on iraqi civilians four days after americans first penetrated the baghdad outskirts is unknown .
but the world health organization said baghdad ' s hospitals were running out of supplies to treat the burns , sh ##ra ##p ##nel wounds and spinal injuries caused by the fighting .
iraqi officials , however , remained defiant , saying iraq ' s forces would never surrender to american forces : ` ` they will be burnt , ' ' said information minister mohammed sa ##eed al - sa ##hh ##af .
in central baghdad , a reuters camera ##man and a camera ##man for spain ' s tel ##ecin ##co died when an american tank fired on the palestine hotel .
` ` the incident . . . raises questions about the judgment of the advancing u . s . troops who have known all along that this hotel is the main base for almost all foreign journalists in baghdad , ' ' reuters editor - in - chief gee ##rt lin ##ne ##bank said .
tar ##e ##q a ##y ##you ##b , a journalist with al - ja ##zee ##ra , died when a u . s . warp ##lane bombed the arab - language satellite television ' s office .
an abu dhabi tv office in baghdad also was hit .
al - ja ##zee ##ra cat ##egorical ##ly denied that its baghdad bureau had been used by iraqi forces to fire on u . s . troops .
u . s . central command said it fired on the tv office and the hotel after u . s . forces came under ` ` significant ' ' fire from those buildings .
associated press photographer jerome delay said he watched from the top floor of the hotel as american tanks took up positions on the bridge .
` ` all the shooting was concentrated on the bridge and across the river , ' ' where u . s . forces were located , he said .
it was not clear whether any iraqi leader had been killed in the airs ##tri ##ke targeting saddam in an upscale baghdad neighborhood .
iraqi rescue workers pulled two bodies from the rubble but said the toll could be as high as 14 .
` ` i do n ' t know whether he survived , ' ' u . s president george w . bush said of saddam at a joint news conference with british prime minister tony blair .
` ` the only thing i know is that he ' s losing power . ' '
iraq ' s u . n . ambassador , mohammed al - do ##uri , said tuesday he believes that saddam is alive , although al - do ##uri acknowledged he has not communicated with baghdad .
bush and blair sought to minimize their differences over who should govern and rebuild iraq .
blair favors a stronger u . n . role than bush .
` ` there will be a vital role for the u . n . in the reconstruction of iraq , ' ' blair said .
` ` but the key is that iraq in the end will be run by the iraqi people . ' '
in northern iraq , kurdish forces tightened their ring around kirk ##uk on tuesday , following heavy coalition airs ##tri ##kes on iraqi fronts . kurdish militia took control of se ##kam ##ian plateau , about 10 kilometers ( six miles ) north of kirk ##uk , kurdish media reported .
the area afford ##s a commanding view of the city and the vast oil fields of iraq ' s no . 2 oil region .
the u . s . military said two planes had been lost .
an a - 10 ` ` war ##th ##og ' ' warp ##lane was shot down near baghdad , believed to be the first fixed - wing aircraft downed by an iraqi surface - to - air missile since the war began .
u . s . central command said the pilot ejected , was recovered by ground forces and was in good condition .
a u . s . f - 15 ##e jet fighter also went down early monday and a search was under way for its two - man crew , the military announced tuesday . officials did not say whether the plane was shot down or crashed accidentally .

iraq ' s u . n . ambassador meets anna ##n , wo n ' t discuss future plans
united nations ( ap )
iraq ' s u . n . ambassador mohammed al - do ##uri , the first iraqi official to con ##cede defeat in the u . s . - led war , met privately with secretary - general ko ##fi anna ##n , but refused to talk about rumors that he was planning to leave new york .
` ` i am sorry , ' ' he said .
` ` no answer . ' '
` ` no comment at all .
this is my last word to you , ' ' he told horde ##s of journalists who chased him thursday at his new york residence and u . n . headquarters seeking comment on his talks with the secretary - general , his future and the war .
asked who should govern iraq , al - do ##uri said : ` ` i have nothing to do with that . ' '
anna ##n also declined to comment on thursday ' s meeting with al - do ##uri .
with the fall of baghdad wednesday , al - do ##uri declared ` ` the game is over ' ' and expressed hope that the iraqi people will now be able to live in peace .
he said he had not been in touch with baghdad .
beside meeting with anna ##n , al - do ##uri spent several hours during the late morning and afternoon meeting with ambassadors and diplomats in the delegate ' s lounge .
` ` i wished him good luck but i do n ' t know what he said to the secretary - general and what will be his next steps , ' ' said arab league secretary - general am ##r mo ##uss ##a , who talked with al - do ##uri before his own meeting with anna ##n .
in an interview with the associated press wednesday night , al - do ##uri said he will continue to work at the united nations and had no intention of defect ##ing .
` ` defect ##ing from who ? ' '
he asked .
` ` i think the government has already defected .
there is no more iraqi government to be defected from . ' '
anna ##n said early thursday _ before meeting al - do ##uri _ that in talks with the envoy monday , ` ` he did n ' t ask for an asylum or protection . . . ( and ) he did n ' t ask me for help with his status . ' '
` ` we did talk about what happens , depending on the evolution of things on the ground , ' ' anna ##n said .
the ambassador had ve ##hem ##ently defended his country for months as the united states and its allies sought u . n . backing for war on iraq . privately , many u . n . diplomats see him as a respectable colleague .
` ` i sy ##mp ##athi ##ze with his need to create a new life for himself , ' ' said britain ' s u . n . ambassador jeremy greens ##tock .
al - do ##uri taught international law at baghdad university for over 30 years before becoming a diplomat in 1999 , first at the united nations in geneva and since early 2001 at u . n . headquarters in new york .
he said in the ap interview he would love to return to teaching but for now he plans to remain at the united nations .
` ` things will be crystal ##ized one day , ' ' he said .
` ` what i worried about is that things are settled in the country . . . so in the future the iraqi people will live in peace without sanctions , without wars , without suffering .
this is my message . ' '
separately , lawyers who claim that iraq helped plan the 1995 oklahoma city bombing that killed 168 people asked a judge at a federal court in new york to force al - do ##uri to testify in the case and hold the envoy in contempt , saying they worry that he would flee the country .
but u . n . spokesman fred ec ##khar ##d said al - do ##uri still has diplomatic immunity as iraq ' s ambassador .
under u . n . rules , a new iraqi government would have to ask to represent the country , which the general assembly would then consider .
` ` he is still iraq ' s ambassador at the united nations , ' '
white house spokesman ari fl ##eis ##cher said in washington .
` ` legally , that is the way it works at the u . n . ' '
larry k ##lay ##man , chairman of judicial watch , which represent 14 survivors and victims ' relatives who have filed a $ 1 . 5 billion federal lawsuit against iraq in washington , said his organization had served a sub ##po ##ena on al - do ##uri twice , on march 26 and march 28 , but said he has not responded .
u . s . district judge john s . martin did not immediately rule but scheduled a hearing for next week .
the april 19 , 1995 , bombing of the alfred p . mu ##rra ##h federal building was the dead ##liest terrorist strike on american soil at the time .
the suit claims iraqi officials provided money and training to convicted bomber timothy mc ##ve ##igh and con ##sp ##ira ##tor terry nichols .
mc ##ve ##igh was executed in 2001 , and nichols is serving a life sentence .

spur ##ned by u . s . over human rights , indonesia turns to russia for arms
jakarta , indonesia ( ap )
the dictator su ##hart ##o has fallen , the constitution has changed , the media was un ##sha ##ckle ##d , democratic elections held , and east timor freed .
after sept . 11 , 2001 , indonesia was quick to sign onto u . s . president george w . bush ' s global war on terror .
yet , washington maintains a 12 - year ban on arms sales to the world ' s most populous muslim nation with the aim of curb ##ing human rights abuses still happening despite moment ##ous political change .
frustrated , jakarta ' s generals are looking elsewhere to replace anti ##qua ##ted arsenal ##s .
later this month indonesian president mega ##wat ##i su ##kar ##no ##put ##ri travels to moscow to seek the k ##rem ##lin ' s help in modern ##izing her increasingly obsolete 300 , 000 - member armed forces .
she is also likely to open the way for russian companies to vie for lucrative deals in the oil and gas sector , long dominated by american and british resource giants .
although opposite ends of the earth , indonesia and russia have some basic things in common .
both are geographically sprawling with massive multi ##eth ##nic populations .
both are struggling to preserve national unity as they fight sep ##arat ##ism and build democracy after the collapse of decades of authoritarian rule .
both are resource - rich , but face huge economic problems made worse by endemic corruption .
and , currently , both have opposed the u . s . - led war on iraq .
indonesia ' s foreign ministry spokesman marty natal ##ega ##wa says mega ##wat ##i ' s meeting with russian president putin slated for april 21 will touch on the iraq crisis .
but other diplomats say that issue will serve primarily to bring the two closer together on bottom - line issues such as trade and arms sales .
analysts worry that indonesia ' s military is now so degraded it can no longer control the borders of the far - flung archipelago , allowing for easy in ##filtration by ex ##tre ##mist ##s .
last year ' s bali bombings , which killed 202 people , illustrated the threat of terrorism in indonesia .
and , broad opposition to the u . s . - led attack on iraq threatens to lead to a backlash by militant islamist ##s .
` ` nearly everybody in indonesia sees this iraq war as completely unnecessary and there is widespread public opposition to u . s . policies , ' ' said ju ##su ##f wan ##adi of the center for strategic and international studies in jakarta .
close ties between moscow and jakarta are not unprecedented .
indonesia relied on soviet military assistance in the 1950s under mega ##wat ##i ' s father and founding president su ##kar ##no , but these were severed after the anti - communist gen . su ##hart ##o seized power in 1965 .
the united states quickly became the southeast asian country ' s main weapons supplier , and annual arms sales peaked at us $ 400 million in the 1980s .
in 1991 , however , the u . s . congress banned this after indonesian troops killed hundreds of civilians in east timor .
in 1999 , east timor became free , but only after indonesian forces laid waste to it as they withdrew after a pro - independence referendum .
the shocking level of destruction prompted u . s . law ##makers to expand the ban to cover almost all military ties with indonesia .
since then some in the bush administration _ particularly deputy defense secretary paul wolf ##ow ##itz , a former ambassador to jakarta and a prime architect of the iraq war _ have pushed for the ban to be repealed .
so far , u . s . law ##makers have reinstated only a limited officer training program .
but that ' s far from enough for indonesia ' s generals .
` ` i think the indonesian military has finally decided that restrictions and conditional ##ities from washington are just not worth it , ' ' said ju ##won ##o sud ##ars ##ono , a former defense minister .
` ` so they want to look for alternative sources for planes , helicopters and other hardware . ' '
moscow has already had some success in woo ##ing indonesia as a customer .
jakarta has recently purchased some russian weapons , including 10 , 000 kala ##sh ##nikov assault rifles , a squadron of naval mil - 2 helicopters and a dozen bt ##r - 80 ##a amphibious carriers for its marines .
currently , indonesia uses short - range rap ##ier missiles purchased 30 years ago to protect its vital oil and natural gas fields in sumatra , borneo and papua from air attack .
` ` rep ##len ##ishing them has been a big problem , ' ' sud ##ars ##ono said .
air defense commanders want to aug ##ment the rap ##iers with russia ' s impressive long - range s - 300 missiles , or shorter - range systems such as the sa - 15 gaunt ##let or shoulder - fired i ##gl ##a .
the air force is reportedly considering purchasing several squadrons of su ##kh ##oi su - 27 interceptor ##s , considered the world ' s premier dog ##fighter ##s .
previously , indonesian air force commanders preferred western jets that were compatible with the u . s . - made f - 16 fighter - bombers already in the indonesian inventory .
but neighboring malaysia ' s success in integrating russian mig - 29 ##s and american f / a - 18 hornets persuaded them otherwise , sud ##ars ##ono said .
if mega ##wat ##i does stiff - arm the united states on the weapons issue , it is unlikely relations with washington will be permanently damaged . whatever happens , indonesia , a mainly muslim but politically secular state , is natural ally in the struggle against terrorism and religious mil ##itan ##cy .
what could be more worrying for washington is russia ' s economic ambitions .
trade between indonesia and russia increased by dl ##rs 36 . 2 million to dl ##rs 203 . 5 million in 2001 _ the last year for which statistics are available .
analysts say this can only grow .
the real concerns , though , are in the petroleum sector .
mega ##wat ##i and putin are expected to sign agreements to give russian companies a toe ##hold in indonesia ' s oil and gas industry , long dominated by american and british giants such as ex ##xon mob ##il and bp .

czech nuclear plant gets permission to produce at full capacity
prague , czech republic ( ap )
the troubled nuclear power plant in te ##mel ##in received permission from state authorities monday to start power production at full capacity .
pavel pitt ##erman , the spokesman for the state office for nuclear safety , said his office gave the plant permission to run its second , newer 1 , 000 - mega ##wat ##t unit at full capacity .
the plant ' s first 1 , 000 - mega ##wat ##t unit has already operated at full capacity during past tests .
the spokesman for the te ##mel ##in plant , milan ne ##bes ##ar , said that an 18 - month trial production at full capacity at the second unit , needed to declare the unit ready for commercial production , would start friday .
the plant , based on russian design and upgraded with u . s . technology , has been plagued by frequent , non - nuclear mal ##fu ##nction ##s since testing began in november 2000 .
located just 60 kilometers ( 35 miles ) north of the austrian border , it has been a source of friction between the two countries .
critics in non - nuclear austria argue the plant is unsafe and demand that it be shut down , but czech authorities insist the plant is safe .
the plant ' s first unit , currently shut down for planned maintenance scheduled to take two months , has already entered the last stage of tests and should be ready for commercial use at the end of 2003 .

u . s . and iraqi ##s look to form new government , but some groups boycott meeting
ur , iraq ( ap )
a u . s . - sponsored forum that brought iraqi opposition leaders together to shape the country ' s postwar government began tuesday with a u . s . promise not to rule iraq and concluded with an agreement to meet again in 10 days .
meeting in the biblical birthplace of the prophet abraham , delegates from iraq ' s many factions discussed the role of religion in the future government and ways to rebuild the country .
but some shi ##ite muslim groups boycott ##ed the meeting and thousands protested nearby .
a 13 - point statement released after the meeting stressed the need to work toward a democratic iraq built on the rule of law and equality . it also called for di ##sso ##lving saddam ' s ba ##ath party but left open the question of separating church from the state .
retired lt . gen . jay garner , who will head the u . s . - led interim administration in iraq , opened the conference under a golden - colored tent in the shadows of the 4 , 000 - year - old z ##ig ##gur ##at at ur , a terrace ##d temple platform of the ancient sum ##erian ##s .
` ` what better birthday can a man have than to begin it not only where civilization began but where a free iraq and a democratic iraq will begin today ? ' '
said garner , who turned 65 tuesday and wore a twin american and iraqi flag pin on his blue shirt .
white house envoy za ##lma ##y k ##hal ##il ##za ##d told delegates that the united states has ` ` no interest , absolutely no interest , in ruling iraq . ' '
` ` we want you to establish your own democratic system based on iraqi traditions and values , ' ' k ##hal ##il ##za ##d said .
` ` i urge you to take this opportunity to cooperate with each other . ' '
participants included ku ##rds , sunni ##s and shi ##ites from inside the country and others who spent years in exile .
u . s . officials invited the groups , which picked their own representatives .
many iraqi ##s boycott ##ed the meeting in opposition to u . s . plans to install garner atop an interim administration .
thousands of shi ##ites _ who constitute iraq ' s most populous religious group but were rep ##ressed under saddam hussein _ demonstrated in nearby nas ##iri ##yah , chanting ` ` no to america and no to saddam ! ' '
` ` iraq needs an iraqi interim government .
anything other than this tram ##ples the rights of the iraqi people and will be a return to the era of colonization , ' ' said abdul aziz ha ##kim , a leader of the largest iraqi shi ##ite group , the supreme council for islamic revolution in iraq .
u . s . officials hope more iraqi ##s join the process and stressed that this was just the first of many such meetings in iraq .
the meeting concluded with the delegates voting by show of hands to meet again in 10 days .
a national conference is planned to select the interim administration , perhaps within weeks , a senior u . s . official said on condition of an ##ony ##mity .
the interim administration could begin handing power back to iraqi officials within three to six months , but forming a government will take longer , said maj . gen . tim cross , the top british member of garner ' s team .
` ` one has to go through the process of building from the bottom up , allowing the leadership to establish itself , and then the election process to go through and so forth , ' ' cross said .
` ` that full electoral process may well take longer . ' '
garner ' s office of reconstruction and humanitarian assistance is charged with coordinating humanitarian assistance , rebuilding infrastructure shattered by years of war and u . n . sanctions , and gradually handing back power to iraqi ##s leading a democratic ##ally elected government .
tuesday ' s meeting was the first step toward that goal after the ou ##ster of saddam .
she ##ik a ##yad jamal al din , a shi ##ite religious leader from nas ##iri ##yah , urged the delegates to craft a secular government , according to a pool report .
but nas ##sar hussein musa ##wi , a school ##teacher , disagreed : ` ` those who would like to separate religion from the state are simply dreaming , ' ' he said .
iraqi exile hate ##m mu ##kh ##lis ##s quoted president john f . kennedy ' s ex ##hort ##ation , ` ` ask not what your country can do for you , but what you can do for your country , ' ' and called on iraqi ##s to write a constitution , establish a legal system and consider what role the army should play .
he asked coalition representatives to address problems of security , electricity and water in iraq and help rebuild destroyed and looted hospitals .
` ` saddam reduced the country to such a state that it was necessary for people to sell off personal possessions , ' ' mu ##kh ##lis ##s said .
` ` now it ' s time to take our country back . ' '
there are already tensions between the united states and some iraqi factions .
kurdish groups appear unwilling to compromise on their demand to expand the border of their autonomous area to include the oil - rich city of kirk ##uk and kurdish parts of the city of mo ##sul .
that could pose a problem for the united states , because turkey worries that kurdish control of kirk ##uk could lead to aspirations for independence and in turn encourage sep ##arat ##ist ku ##rds in turkey .
iraqi opposition leaders fear the united states is trying to force ahmed cha ##lab ##i , head of the london - based umbrella iraqi national congress , on them as leader of a new iraqi administration .
cha ##lab ##i was the first top iraqi opposition leader to be airlift ##ed by the u . s . military into southern iraq as the fighting wound down , and he and other top members of his group plan to meet soon in baghdad . u . s . officials said cha ##lab ##i was brought in because he offered forces to the coalition .
neither cha ##lab ##i nor many other leaders of anti - saddam groups attended tuesday ' s meeting , but they sent delegates .
iraqi ##s protesting the conference said it did not represent their interests .
the protesters held banners written in english and arabic saying the ` ` ha ##w ##za , ' ' or the shi ##ite religious seminary in na ##ja ##f , represents them .
even some of those at the meeting said they did not want garner leading the interim administration .
` ` we will press for any iraqi civilian administration regardless of what the americans say .
an administration by garner is not acceptable , ' ' said mo ##wa ##ffa ##k al - rub ##ai ##e , an iraqi physician and opposition activist .
he said american officials have outlined what garner ' s administration would look like : each ministry would be headed by an american , either military or civilian .
each minister would have two american deputies and eight american advisers , plus four iraqi advisers from inside the country and four iraqi exiles .

appeal launched against russian journalist ' s treason conviction
moscow ( ap )
the lawyer for a russian military journalist convicted of treason filed an appeal wednesday in an effort to over ##turn the guilty verdict against his client , who was released on parole earlier this year , news agencies reported .
gr ##igo ##ry pas ##ko ' s lawyer gen ##ri re ##z ##nik filed the appeal with russian supreme court , the inter ##fa ##x and it ##ar - ta ##ss news agencies reported .
he asked the court to invalid ##ate the verdict and throw out the criminal case against pas ##ko , they said .
pas ##ko was sentenced to four years in prison in december 2001 for illegally attending a meeting of top military commanders and taking notes there .
a military court said he intended to pass the notes to japanese media with which he had worked .
pas ##ko , whose sentence included time served , was released in january for good behavior after serving more than two - thirds of the sentence . he has maintained his innocence , saying the military was punish ##ing him for exposing environmental abuses by the russian navy , including the dumping of radioactive waste into the sea .
re ##z ##nik said an initial appeal he lodged the day pas ##ko was freed never reached the pre ##si ##dium of the supreme court , according to inter ##fa ##x . the lawyer said the court ' s military board had refused to launch proceedings on the appeal .
re ##z ##nik said he addressed the new appeal directly to supreme court chairman v ##ya ##ches ##lav le ##bed ##ev and asked that it not be considered by military judges ` ` because the military justice system has adopted a biased attitude against pas ##ko , ' ' inter ##fa ##x reported .

u . s . troops capture saddam ' s half brother , stop major bank robbery in capital
baghdad , iraq ( ap )
american commandos captured a half brother of saddam hussein on thursday , the latest success in a campaign to round up insider ##s from the former regime .
u . s . troops thwarted a baghdad bank robbery over the protests of iraqi ##s eager to share in the lo ##ot .
as u . s . forces struggled to restore order in iraq , fbi director robert mueller announced that agents had been detailed to help recover antiquities looted from museums in baghdad and elsewhere . agents will aid international efforts to recover stolen items ` ` on both the open and black markets , ' ' he said .
with the fighting all but over , the uss constellation steamed from the persian gulf for its home port , carrying dozens of warp ##lane ##s no longer needed .
it was the second aircraft carrier ordered home in recent days .
the u . s . military ' s search for chemical and biological weapons is unlikely to succeed until iraqi ##s lead american forces to them , defense secretary donald h . rum ##sf ##eld said thursday .
` ` i do n ' t think we ' ll discover anything , myself , ' ' rum ##sf ##eld said at a meeting with pentagon employees .
` ` i think what will happen is we ' ll discover people who will tell us where to go find it . ' '
u . s . troops have found suspicious chemicals and facilities at a number of sites but tests on the materials have proved negative or inc ##on ##clusive .
eliminating such weapons was a chief reason president george w . bush gave for the u . s . - led invasion of iraq that began march 20 .
brig . gen . vincent brooks announced the capture of bar ##zan ibrahim hasan al - ti ##kr ##iti , telling reporters he was an adviser to saddam ` ` with extensive knowledge of the regime ' s inner workings . ' '
a u . s . intelligence official , speaking on condition of an ##ony ##mity , said bar ##zan ibrahim had been a presidential adviser to saddam ' s regime since 1998 , but had a shaky relationship with his half brother and was not part of the regime ' s inner circle .
he was a representative to the united nations in geneva from 1989 to 1998 .
earlier , from 1979 to 1983 , he headed iraq ' s mu ##kha ##bara ##t , or intelligence service , a period when the organization arranged executions of regime opponents in iraq and overseas , the official said .
brooks provided scan ##t details of the operation that net ##ted bar ##zan ibrahim , saying he was taken inside baghdad and that u . s . special forces were aided by marines .
he said there were no casualties .
another of saddam ' s three half brothers , wat ##ban ibrahim hasan al - ti ##kr ##iti , was captured earlier by u . s . forces .
the third has not been found .
american forces have been criticized for failing to stop looting in several baghdad cities , and there have been complaints , as well , that humanitarian relief has been slow in arriving .
but marines foil ##ed a bra ##zen act of law ##lessness during the day when they interrupted a robbery - in - progress at a branch of the al - rashid bank and took away us $ 4 million for safe ##keeping .
thieves had blown a hole in the vault and dropped children in to bring out fist ##ful ##s of cash .
as word spread that the robbery was under way , iraqi ##s gathered , saying they had accounts at the branch , and a riot broke out .
marines broke it up _ over the protests of iraqi ##s not involved in the robbery _ and the thieves were arrested .
` ` these people want the money and they believe it is rightful ##ly their money , but they do n ' t understand that the proper distribution is not first - come , first - served , ' ' said col . philip dec ##amp , a battalion commander .
gen . tommy franks , the commander of operation iraqi freedom , told reporters during a visit to kuwait that ` ` the looting goes down every day and i think you will continue to see it go down because the iraqi ##s are now stepping up and controlling the problems for themselves . ' '
there was evidence of slow progress .
baghdad residents gathered outside the city ' s police academy when word spread that some of the cars looted in recent days had been recovered .
still , more than a week after the regime collapsed , marine staff sgt . jose gui ##llen said power has been restored _ by use of diesel plants
_ to only about 500 homes in baghdad , a city of roughly 5 million . he said u . s . forces expect to get one of the city ' s power grid ##s on line by friday .
unrest continued in other parts of the country .
americans sought to bring calm to mo ##sul , where u . s . troops killed 17 people in clashes earlier in the week .
brooks , briefing reporters at the u . s . central command headquarters , also disclosed that marines had broken up violent clashes on wednesday in ti ##kr ##it , saddam ' s hometown .
the fighting broke out between club - wielding members of the former ruler ' s clan and a rival group , he said .
clan rival ##ries aside , there are numerous other resentment ##s shaping events in the post - saddam era .
majority shi ##ite muslims are eager for power after decades of saddam favor ##ing sunni muslims , for example . and ku ##rds are eager to claim what they say saddam took from them and gave to arabs in the northern part of the country .
international experts , appalled at the looting of iraqi historical artifacts , met in paris under u . n . auspices and called for a temporary em ##bar ##go on iraqi cultural objects .
some of the participants at the meeting said it appeared the looting was organized , and some of those involved had keys to museum vaults and were able to remove items from safe ##s .
one suggested the effort was organized from outside iraq .
` ` it looks as if part of the looting was a deliberate planned action , ' ' said mcguire gibson , a university of chicago professor and president of the american association for research in baghdad .
` ` i have a suspicion it was organized outside the country , in fact i ' m pretty sure it was , ' ' gibson said .
he added that if a good police team was put together , ` ` i think it could be cracked in no time . ' '
the baghdad museum housed ir ##re ##pl ##ace ##able babylonian , sum ##erian and assyrian collections that chronicle ##d ancient life in the cradle of civilization , the area around the ti ##gr ##is and eu ##ph ##rates rivers .

malaysian court rejects anwar ' s appeal against so ##dom ##y conviction
kuala lumpur , malaysia ( ap )
malaysia ' s second highest court on friday rejected an appeal by jailed former deputy prime minister anwar ibrahim against his conviction and nine - year prison sentence for so ##dom ##y .
a three - judge panel of the court of appeals unanimously upheld a verdict by high court judge ari ##fin ja ##ka nearly three years ago that found anwar guilty of so ##dom ##izing his wife ' s former driver .
so ##dom ##y is a crime in this predominantly muslim southeast asian country .
anwar is expected to appeal again with the federal court , malaysia ' s highest court .
speaking to reporters after the verdict , anwar lamb ##ast ##ed the judges , saying they had been ` ` pre ##sel ##ect ##ed ' ' by the government to qu ##ash his appeal .
` ` these are spine ##less judges , ' ' anwar said .
` ` this decision is all scripted . ' '
the judges also rejected an application by anwar to be released on bail .
but anwar ' s lawyers said they were filing a fresh request for bail pending a further appeal .
on monday , anwar completed his sentence for a separate conviction on corruption charges , after the six - year sentence was reduced by one - third for good behavior .
he then began serving the nine - year prison sentence for so ##dom ##y , his lawyers said .
prime minister maha ##thi ##r mo ##ham ##ad fired anwar , his former protege , in 1998 following disputes over financial policy .
anwar led large protests against maha ##thi ##r before he was arrested , charged and convicted on corruption and so ##dom ##y charges .
anwar claims the charges were fabricated to keep him from challenging maha ##thi ##r for power .
the government denies this .
human rights group amnesty international said friday ' s verdict ` ` represents another step in the further deterioration in the human rights situation in the country . ' '
` ` this decision adds to the already widespread perception that in politically sensitive cases , the independence of the judiciary can no longer be guaranteed , ' ' the london - based group said in a statement . ` ` today , the situation looks much bleak ##er . ' '
para ##m cum ##ara ##sw ##amy , the u . n . special investigator on the freedom of judges and lawyers , said in a statement : ` ` so long as there are judges who are prepared to and continue to compromise the value and principles of their high office . . . there is no hope for judicial independence and imp ##art ##ial ##ity in the malaysian justice system . ' '
about 200 demonstrators outside the court shouted anwar ' s slogan of ` ` reform ##asi ! ' '
for political change .
police armed with automatic weapons stood by to prevent row ##dine ##ss .
the court also dismissed a joint appeal by anwar ' s adopted brother , su ##km ##a dar ##ma ##wan , who was convicted together with anwar for so ##dom ##y in august 2000 and sentenced to six years in jail and whipping .
su ##km ##a has been free on bail pending appeal , but the judges on friday ordered him to begin his sentence .

france proposes suspend ##ing u . n . sanctions against iraq , a step toward u . s . goal
united nations ( ap )
france on tuesday proposed immediately suspend ##ing u . n . sanctions targeting iraq civilians , an important step toward the u . s . goal of ending trade em ##bar ##go ##es that have crippled the country ' s economy .
the surprise move by france , which led opposition to the u . s . war against iraq , followed last week ' s call by u . s . president george w . bush for sanctions to be lifted quickly , so iraq can trade freely and its oil revenue can be used to finance reconstruction .
france ' s u . n . ambassador , jean - marc de la sa ##bl ##iere , made the proposal at a security council meeting where members heard a briefing by chief u . n . weapons inspector hans b ##li ##x and for the first time exchanged views on potentially di ##vis ##ive postwar issues .
the proposal would end the u . n . ban on trade and investment in iraq while leaving a 12 - year - old arms em ##bar ##go in place .
the security council imposed sanctions after iraq ' s 1990 invasion of kuwait .
under council resolutions , sanctions can not be lifted until u . n . inspectors ce ##rti ##fy that iraq ' s nuclear , chemical and biological weapons have been destroyed along with the long - range missiles to deliver them .
along with france , russia , germany and china also strongly opposed the war .
but de la sa ##bl ##iere said before the meeting that security council ` ` must take into account the new realities on the ground . ' '
russian ambassador sergey la ##vr ##ov had said his country is ` ` not at all opposed to the lifting of sanctions . ' '
but he said russia wants u . n . inspectors to ce ##rti ##fy that iraq has been di ##sar ##med of all weapons of mass destruction , as required under u . n . resolutions .
asked about the french proposal , he said : ` ` we are ready to discuss it . ' '
at another closed - door council meeting later tuesday , the council was to hear from ben ##on se ##van , head of the u . n . oil - for - food program , which had been providing food for 60 percent of iraq ' s 24 million people .
france ' s de la sa ##bl ##iere said he also proposed that the council phase out the oil - for - food program , which allowed iraq to sell unlimited quantities of oil provided the money went for humanitarian goods and compensation to victims of the first gulf war .
` ` there should be some adjustment with a view of a ph ##asi ##ng out of this program , ' ' de la sa ##bl ##iere said .
this is one of the difficult decisions the council will face in the weeks ahead on di ##vis ##ive issues stemming from the war against iraq .
these include not only iraq ' s di ##sar ##mament and the future of sanctions but the u . n . role in iraq now that the fighting is over , control of iraq ' s oil revenue , and lucrative reconstruction contracts .
b ##li ##x stressed that council resolutions call for u . n . inspectors to have access to all sites and people in iraq .
he said he told the council that he believes the world would like iraq ' s di ##sar ##mament confirmed by an international body that has been involved in the country for over 10 years .
the bush administration , which accused b ##li ##x of hind ##ering its drive for international support for the war , has already sent its own teams to iraq to search for illegal weapons .
` ` at the moment , the coalition has assumed the responsibilities for di ##sar ##ming iraq , ' ' u . s . ambassador john negro ##pon ##te , said tuesday when asked whether u . s . teams would work with u . n . inspectors .
he said important scientists had turned themselves in , and the atmosphere had changed which should enable any iraqi ` ` to speak more freely and speak without fear of retribution to those who are asking them the questions . ' '
france ' s de la sa ##bl ##iere said he also proposed that the council ` ` find practical and pr ##ag ##matic arrangements ' ' to coordinate and combine the work of the american teams and the work of u . n . inspectors ` ` so that the iraqi di ##sar ##mament could be internationally verified . ' '
he told the associated press he envisioned sanctions being suspended ` ` for a couple of months , ' ' and possibly renewed .
he also envisioned u . s . and u . n . inspectors working together .
` ` and then sanctions could be lifted when a legitimate iraqi government is in place , ' ' he said .
in an interview with bbc radio aired tuesday , b ##li ##x said that before the war , the u . s . and britain appeared to have used ` ` shaky ' ' intelligence , including forged documents , in an effort to prove iraq had banned weapons .
b ##li ##x said it was ` ` very , very disturbing ' ' that u . s . intelligence failed to identify as fake ##s documents suggesting iraq tried to buy uranium from the west african nation of niger .
he told reporters at the united nations on tuesday that the contract about ` ` yellow cake ' ' uranium ` ` was more than shaky , it was a fake . ' '
u . n . inspectors went back to iraq for the first time in four years in late november and discovered no weapons of mass destruction during 3 { months of searching .
secretary - general ko ##fi anna ##n ordered all u . n . international staff , including the inspectors , to leave iraq just before the war began on march 20 .
he has said he expects them to return .
anna ##n also said tuesday in austria that iraqi ##s should be in charge of their own future and natural resources .
he acknowledged that ` ` the u . n . is being challenged ' ' but said he expected an agreement on the u . n . role in iraq in the ` ` not too distant future . ' '

north korea tough talk provides backdrop for second day of nuclear talks with united states , china
beijing ( ap )
talks between north korea , the united states and china ended thursday with u . s . state department officials saying it was uncertain whether discussions on p ##yon ##gy ##ang ' s nuclear program would continue .
although north korea accused the united states of leading the region toward war in its state media , u . s . officials denied reports the talks had broken down .
north korea also hinted during the meetings that they have nuclear weapons and may conduct a test , a u . s . official said .
earlier , secretary of state colin powell had told a gathering of experts from the asia - pacific region that the talks had concluded , leaving the impression there would not be a third day of discussions on friday .
powell also expressed hope that south korea and japan will be able to participate ` ` when and if ' ' there is another round of talks .
` ` north korea should not leave the meetings having the slightest impression that they might force us to make a concession we would not otherwise make , ' ' he added .
but u . s . state department officials , asking not to be identified , said there may be more meetings on friday .
they said reports of a breakdown in the talks were a ` ` mis ##re ##pres ##entation . ' '
one official said : ` ` we had the opportunity to say what we needed to say and to hear what the north koreans wanted to tell us . ' '
a u . s . official said the north koreans implied during the talks that they have nuclear weapons and that they may conduct a test .
but the official said there are no indications a test is imminent .
he acknowledged that preparations for an underground test could be concealed .
according to the official , a north korean nuclear det ##ona ##tion would de ##ple ##te by half their estimated stock ##pile of two weapons .
in beijing , chief u . s . ne ##go ##tia ##tor , assistant secretary of state james kelly , declined to answer questions , saying only the sides ` ` had talks . ' '
chinese foreign ministry spokesman liu jian ##cha ##o refused to provide details , but said the talks were ` ` con ##du ##ci ##ve to mutual understanding and finding ways to resolve the north korean nuclear question peacefully . ' '
discussions were scheduled to end friday , when kelly was to fly to seoul the same day to meet with south korean officials .
the talks are the first high - level u . s . - north korean contact since tensions over the north ' s nuclear program spiked six months ago over washington ' s claim that the north said in october it was trying to develop nuclear weapons in violation of a 1994 pledge .
the north has disputed the u . s . claim .
washington and its allies suspended fuel shipments to north korea as punishment .
the north re ##tal ##iated by withdrawing from the nuclear non - proliferation treaty , ex ##pel ##ling u . n . inspectors and restart ##ing a pluto ##nium - producing reactor .
north korea , which is seeking a guarantee from the united states that it wo n ' t be attacked , rat ##chet ##ed up the threat of conflict in a statement issued by its official korean central news agency accusing washington of es ##cala ##ting tensions .
the north ' s leaders fear they could be the next target for u . s . military action .
` ` the situation on the korean peninsula is so tense that a war may break out any moment due to the u . s . moves , ' ' the kc ##na statement said .
it said relations with the united states had hit ` ` rock bottom ' ' because u . s . president george w . bush named north korea as part of an ` ` axis of evil , ' ' along with iran and iraq .
kc ##na said the war in iraq had shown the only way for a country to protect itself was to have a strong military deter ##rent .
officials from seoul and washington say the swift u . s . - led victory in iraq prompted north korea to agree to the nuclear talks .
north korea said the ` ` master key ' ' for successful talks was for the united states to drop its hostile policy toward p ##yon ##gy ##ang .
in a likely reference to north korea ' s demand for a non ##ag ##gre ##ssion treaty with washington , kc ##na said : ` ` the u . s . should settle the talks from a sincere stand and strive to settle the essential issue . ' '
washington has refused to offer a formal treaty but says it would consider some sort of written assurance .
the north also likely wants aid for its economy , which has been crippled by the loss of soviet subsidies and years of drought and mis ##mana ##gement .
north korea and china fought against the united states in the 1950 - 53 korean war , which ended without a peace treaty .
north korea and washington have no formal relations and are still technically at war .
china , the north ' s ally and major aid donor , says it does n ' t want p ##yon ##gy ##ang to acquire nuclear weapons and has appealed for a negotiated settlement to the crisis .
a u . s . official praised the chinese contribution to the discussions . he said china ' s delegate specifically called for a den ##uc ##lea ##rized korean peninsula and made specific reference to a 1992 promise p ##yon ##gy ##ang made to south korea not to develop nuclear weapons .
ri gun , deputy director of american affairs for north korea ' s foreign ministry is representing north korea at the talks .
china ' s delegation is led by fu ying , director general of the asian affairs department of its foreign ministry .

gi ##ulia ##ni , 58 , proposed to nathan , a former nurse , during a november business trip to paris
_ five months after he finalized his divorce from donna hanover after 20 years of marriage .
in interviews last year , gi ##ulia ##ni said nathan gave him ` ` tremendous emotional support ' ' through his treatment for prostate cancer and as he led the city during the aftermath of the sept . 11 terrorist attack on the world trade center .
` ` we were close already , ' ' gi ##ulia ##ni said .
` ` and then we went through hell together . ' '
gi ##ulia ##ni and nathan began appearing in public together in may 2000 . soon after , he announced that he and hanover were moving toward legal separation .

last month , she and her fiance _ an old high school sweetheart _ invited the press along as they went shopping for wedding bands , saying they are planning a wedding in the new york city area this summer .
gi ##ulia ##ni ' s first marriage to his second cousin , regina peru ##gg ##i , lasted about 14 years .

report : accident on chinese submarine kills all 70 aboard
beijing ( ap )
an accident on a diesel - powered chinese submarine has killed all 70 officers and sailors aboard , the official xi ##nh ##ua news agency reported friday .
the accident occurred ` ` recently ' ' in chinese waters east of the ne ##ich ##ang ##shan islands , the brief chinese - language report said .
the islands are in the yellow sea , between the northeastern province of lia ##oning and north korea .
the submarine was on an exercise when the accident occurred , and ` ` because of a mechanical mal ##fu ##nction , the 70 crew members on board died , ' ' the xi ##nh ##ua report said .
it did not give further details or say how the crew died .
the vessel already has been towed back to an unidentified port , xi ##nh ##ua said .
it said the hull number was 36 ##1 , which military analysts said appeared to make it a ming - class submarine , a vessel used for patrols and coastal defense .
the announcement was unusual for a communist government that rarely acknowledges military accidents .
it was the first time china has announced a fatal submarine mis ##ha ##p , said bernard cole , a professor at the u . n . national war college in washington and a specialist on the chinese navy .
` ` there have been rumors going around about the loss of submarines , but this is the first fatal accident that i know of , ' ' said cole .
china ' s military , which has a tradition of secrecy , did not comment about the accident friday night .
foreign military analysts said it would be highly unusual for an accident to kill a whole submarine crew while still allowing the vessel to be recovered .
they suggested possible causes ranging from a sinking in shallow water to a disaster that flooded the vessel with toxic chemical fu ##mes .
michael mc ##gin ##ty , an expert on the chinese navy from the royal united services institute for defense studies in london , said that the mis ##ha ##p likely happened while the submarine was on the surface .
if the accident happened when the vessel was underwater , it was less likely that china could have recovered it , said mc ##gin ##ty , a former british submarine ##r .
` ` for an accident to have been so catastrophic when the submarine was on the surface , i find it a very mysterious thing , ' ' he said .
mc ##gin ##ty said that the submarine ' s batteries might have leaked acid that mixed with sea ##water , creating toxic ch ##lor ##ine gas that killed the crew .
the torpedoes might have leaked prop ##ellant that poisoned the crew , he said .
the accident could have occurred as long ago as march , said cole , a former u . s . navy anti ##su ##bm ##ari ##ne warfare officer .
` ` there have been exercises going on in the yellow sea over the past two months , ' ' he said .
` ` this boat could have been involved in those exercises and gone down over a month ago . ' '
cole said the loss of all hands suggested the vessel was flooded or sank because of a collision or engineering problem .
he said ming - class sub ##s usually carry a crew of 50 , suggesting that the others aboard might have been technicians or staff officers .
china began building the ming - class sub ##s in the 1970s , and they are obsolete by modern standards , according to the federation of american scientists .
the first three ming - class sub ##s were completed between 1971 and 1979 , and one of them was scrapped after a fire , according to the web site of jane ' s information group , a leading of source defense information . china is believed to have as many as 19 ming - class submarines .
china ' s submarine fleet includes 66 boats , most of them aging diesel - electric vessels , mc ##gin ##ty said .
he said the fleet suffers from a chronic lack of money , training and maintenance .
but the chinese are aggressively up ##dating their fleet with russian - made ki ##lo - class diesel - electric sub ##s .
` ` the submarine force is the most potent part of the chinese navy , ' ' said cole .
despite the difficulty of maintaining a fleet , sub ##s are valuable because they are hard to detect , cole said .
in a conflict over taiwan or some other confrontation , he said , ` ` china ' s ability to field a force of even a dozen submarines could pose a big problem for any other naval force . ' '
xi ##nh ##ua said former president jiang ze ##min , who is chairman of the commission that runs china ' s military , on friday sent condo ##lence ##s to family members of the crew .

u . s . , britain drafting resolution limiting u . n . role in iraq to humanitarian relief
london ( ap )
the united states and britain are preparing a resolution that would give the united nations a role in humanitarian relief but not peacekeeping in iraq , a senior official in u . s . president george w . bush ' s administration said friday .
separately , the united states has decided to divide the military and humanitarian relief mission in iraq into three parts under american , british and polish command , the official said , speaking on condition of an ##ony ##mity .
six european countries have agreed to contribute troops to the british and polish sectors to create an international stability force , the official said .
the draft resolution would limit the u . n . role to helping with refugees and displaced people , reconstruction and humanitarian assistance , the official said .
the united states and britain agree on all but a few of the fine details of the resolution , the official said , though there is no timetable on when it would be introduced .
u . n . officials are already in iraq providing humanitarian relief . u . n . secretary general ko ##fi anna ##n said this week that the body has no interest in policing a postwar iraq , although it could contribute to the political res ##us ##cit ##ation of the country .
` ` take the question of security .
i do n ' t think the u . n . would want to take on that , ' ' anna ##n said .
` ` there has been a suggestion that the u . n . wanted to take over the whole iraq and run it , which was also not the case . ' '
what the united nations could contribute beyond humanitarian assistance was ` ` political fa ##ci ##lita ##tion , ' ' anna ##n said .
the proposed draft resolution would probably face resistance from other u . n . security council members who have favored a u . n . - convened conference of the kind that helped establish afghanistan ' s post - taliban government .
u . s . defense secretary donald h . rum ##sf ##eld discussed the resolution with prime minister tony blair and defense secretary geoff ho ##on on friday as rum ##sf ##eld returned from a tour of iraq , afghanistan and the persian gulf region .
rum ##sf ##eld said afterward he hoped the u . n . would play a role but did not publicly discuss the draft resolution out ##lining that role .
ho ##on , who joined rum ##sf ##eld in a news conference at heath ##row airport , also did not mention the draft resolution .
` ` we are right to be optimistic about the way forward ' ' in iraq , ho ##on said .
international stability forces will be sent to iraq as soon as possible , the u . s . official said , though it was unclear when that would be .
those troops will work to restore and maintain order and supervise humanitarian projects such as the restoration of water and electricity and delivery of food and medical aid .
the six nations contributing troops are italy , spain , ukraine , denmark , the netherlands and bulgaria , the official said . representatives of those countries will meet with british officials may 7 and polish officials may 22 to determine what forces each country will contribute and whether they will be put under british or polish command .
the u . s . part of the stability force will be comprised of american troops .
while that portion is likely to consist of a military division _ about 20 , 000 _ the troop strength of the other two sectors has yet to be determined , the official said .
the international stabilization force would be under the u . s . war commander , gen . tommy franks .
at least initially , the coalition stability forces will aug ##ment rather than replace the 135 , 000 american troops inside iraq , the official said .
the stability forces will focus on providing security and humanitarian relief while other u . s . troops focus on root ##ing out left ##over members of saddam hussein ' s government and other armed elements in iraq .
rum ##sf ##eld said , however , that the more troops other countries contribute to the stability effort , the fewer u . s . troops will be needed inside iraq .
planning for both the u . n . resolution and the international security force left out france , germany and russia , three u . s . allies that ve ##hem ##ently opposed the war in iraq .
some of the nato members who agreed to send troops may want nato authorization for that action , the official said .
requests for such authorization will be routed through the alliance ' s defense planning committee , which does not include france , the official said .
the outlines for the international stability force were decided at a conference ho ##on hosted wednesday with representatives from 16 countries , mostly nato members .
other countries including the philippines , south korea , qatar and australia agreed to send other help such as field hospitals , engineers , explosive ordnance disposal teams or nuclear , biological and chemical weapons experts .
the u . s . , british and polish sectors will be drawn to take into account ethnic , religious , tribal and political factions within iraq , the official said .
for example , although ethnic ku ##rds are the majority in large parts of northern iraq , there are also large numbers of ku ##rds within baghdad .
some arab countries also want to play a role in the stability operation in iraq but are reluctant to send troops because of political , religious and ethnic considerations , the official said . countries in the gulf cooperation council have offered to donate money for the effort .
rum ##sf ##eld also met friday with king abdullah of jordan , an american ally in the middle east .
defense officials say jordan provided key help in the iraq war , acting as a staging area for u . s . special operations raids into western iraq to prevent missiles from being fired at jordan or israel .
rum ##sf ##eld did not say what the two discussed .

court suspend ##s independent paper for publishing letters deemed religious ##ly inflammatory
k ##hart ##oum , sudan ( ap )
a state security court suspended a newspaper critical of the government saturday after convict ##ing it of publishing religious ##ly inflammatory material , the newspaper ' s lawyer said .
the k ##hart ##oum monitor may not appear for two months and must pay a fine of 1 million sudanese pounds ( about us $ 400 ) , lawyer ngo ##r ol ##ang ngo ##r told the associated press .
failure to pay the fine would result in a two - month extension of the suspension .
the sentence was the latest in a series of state actions against the monitor , the only english language daily in sudan and a leading critic of conditions in the south of the country , where a civil war has been wage ##d for 20 years .
ngo ##r said the paper would pay the fine but it would also appeal the verdict .
the court ruling stated that the verdict and sentence would be submitted to the national press council , a government - appointed body , for approval , ngo ##r said .
the secretary general of the national press council , hash ##im el - jazz , did not answer repeated calls to his cell phone on saturday .
the court convicted the paper of violating article 25 of the press law , which prohibits the publication of material that def ##ame ##s religion or inc ##ites religious ##ly unacceptable activity .
the charges arose from letters - to - the - editor published last month that dealt with religion .
one letter claimed that alcohol was not prohibited by islam .
earlier this week , security police detained the monitor ' s managing editor , nh ##ial bo ##l , for 24 hours .
on his release , he was charged with inc ##ite ##ment of public disco ##rd for publishing the letters .
sudan has an islamic - orient ##ated government and a substantial christian minority .
in a separate action against the monitor , security officials went to its editorial offices on thursday night and told the management that it was being closed until it paid a fine of 15 million sudanese pounds ( about us $ 6 , 000 ) that was outstanding from a court conviction last year .
the monitor did not appear friday and its offices were closed .
in last year ' s trial , the paper was convicted of def ##ami ##ng the government for publishing that trains running to and from southern sudan were used to transport abducted women and children .

north korea may have fired laser at us aircraft , official says , as north null ##ifies accord to keep peninsula nuclear - weapons free
seoul , south korea ( ap )
north korea ' s military may have fired a laser at a u . s . helicopter in march , a u . s . official said tuesday , as the communist state ditch ##ed its last legal obligation to keep itself free of nuclear weapons .
the aircraft ' s ce ##nsor ##s detected the unknown type of laser while it was flying near the heavily fortified frontier that divides the two korea ##s , the u . s . military official said on condition of an ##ony ##mity .
no one was injured and no equipment was damaged in the incident .
north korea said tuesday that a 1992 agreement with south korea not to deploy nuclear arms on the korean peninsula was null ##ified , accusing the united states of der ##ailing the deal .
` ` the inter - korean declaration on den ##uc ##lea ##rization of the korean peninsula was thus reduced to a dead document due to the u . s . vicious hostile policy to st ##if ##le the d ##pr ##k with nu ##kes , ' ' said the north ' s official news agency , kc ##na .
d ##pr ##k stands for the democratic people ' s republic of korea , the north ' s official name .
the announcement came as u . s . president george w . bush and south korean president ro ##h mo ##o - hyun were about to meet wednesday in washington to discuss north korea ' s nuclear programs .
the accord was the last remaining legal obligation under which north korea was banned from developing atomic arms .
in january this year , north korea withdrew from the nuclear non ##pro ##life ##ration treaty , a global accord to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons .
a u . s . military official in seoul , speaking on condition of an ##ony ##mity , said tuesday north korea is believed to have exported us $ 580 million worth of missiles to iran , pakistan , libya , syria , egypt , yemen and the united arab emirates in 2001 .
in december , a shipment of north korean missiles bound for yemen was briefly stopped in the arabian sea .
north korea accuse ##s the united states of planning to attack the communist country , which bush has branded part of an ` ` axis of evil ' ' along with iran and iraq .
it also revived its claim that the u . s . military keeps many nuclear weapons in south korea , turning the country into ` ` the biggest nuclear advance base in the far east . ' '
washington says it wants to use dialogue to resolve the nuclear crisis , although u . s . officials have not ruled out a military option .
north korea ` ` keen ##ly felt that the den ##uc ##lea ##rization of the korean peninsula would only remain as a day ##dre ##am unless the u . s . drops its hostile policy toward the d ##pr ##k , ' ' kc ##na said .
it said the u . s . invasion of iraq taught it that ` ` a war can be ave ##rted and the sovereignty of the country and the security of the nation can be protected only when a country has . . . a strong military deter ##rent force capable of decisive ##ly rep ##elling any attack to be made by any types of sophisticated weapons . ' '
in new york , south korean president ro ##h said he will never condo ##ne north korea ' s nuclear development , but seoul and washington agree the nuclear stand ##off with the north must be solved peacefully ` ` by all means . ' '
` ` it is incumbent upon p ##yon ##gy ##ang to give up its nuclear project and come forward as a responsible member of the international community , ' ' he said .
` ` when the north takes this route , the republic of korea and the international community will extend the necessary support and cooperation . ' '
julian ##ne lee , a ro ##h spoke ##sw ##oman , said the north korean statement might be a negotiating pl ##oy in the wake of talks last month with u . s . officials in beijing .
during the talks in beijing , u . s . officials said north korea claimed it already possesses nuclear weapons , and that it had rep ##ro ##ces ##sed 8 , 000 spent nuclear fuel rods _ a move that could yield several atomic bombs within months .
north korea offered to drop its nuclear and missile programs in exchange for security guarantees and economic aid , according to u . s . officials .
the nuclear crisis flared in october , when washington said north korea admitted having a secret nuclear program in violation of a 1994 treaty with washington .

suicide bombing at israeli shopping mall ; fifth attack in two days
jerusalem ( ap )
a suicide bomber detonated explosives at the entrance to a crowded mall in northern israel on monday , killing at least four shop ##pers and wounding 20 in the fifth such attack in two days .
the spat ##e of bombings under ##sco ##red how difficult it will be to carry out the u . s . - backed ` ` road map ' ' plan , a three - stage prescription for ending violence immediately and setting up a palestinian state by 2005 .
there was no immediate claim of responsibility for monday ' s attack at the sha ##are ##i ama ##kim mall in the working class town of af ##ula , which has been targeted repeatedly by palestinian militants because of its proximity to the west bank .
the islamic militant group hamas carried out four bombings over the weekend .
the af ##ula explosion - the 95 ##th in 32 months of fighting - went off at 5 : 14 p . m . ( 141 ##4 gm ##t ) at the entrance to the mall , reportedly as shop ##pers were waiting in line for a security check .
malls and other public places have significantly stepped up security since the outbreak of israeli - palestinian fighting in september 2000 .
the explosion killed the attacker and four shop ##pers , police said . twenty people were wounded , including several who were in serious condition .
earlier monday , a 19 - year - old palestinian riding a bicycle detonated a 30 - ki ##lo ( 66 - pound ) bomb near a military jeep in the gaza strip , injuring three soldiers .
in response the spat ##e of bombings , israel threatened to boycott foreign envoy ##s who meet with ya ##sser ara ##fat .
israel holds the palestinian leader responsible for the latest violence , even though the recent attacks were carried out by islamic militants .
hamas said monday it has no intention of halt ##ing attacks , despite egypt ' s efforts to have palestinian militant groups agree to a one - year suspension of shooting ##s and bombings .
in a renewed mediation attempt , egyptian envoy ##s have been holding meetings in gaza and damascus in recent days with leaders of the militant groups .
the armed groups say they might agree to a truce if israel promises to stop hunting militants - a proposal israeli prime minister ariel sharon has turned down .
a hamas leader , abd ##el aziz ran ##tis ##i , said monday that ` ` legitimate resistance will continue as long as occupation exists on our holy land . ' '
asked whether hamas was challenging abbas , ran ##tis ##i said only that there was no point in trying to negotiate with sharon , whom he called a ` ` terrorist . ' '
israel said there will be no let ##up in its campaign against those involved in violence .
israel ` ` will continue to fight terror everywhere , at any time and in any way possible , ' ' a cabinet statement said sunday , after a hamas suicide bomber killed seven israelis on a jerusalem bus earlier in the day .
the ministers also decided to cold - shoulder foreign envoy ##s who meet with ara ##fat .
` ` whoever wants to visit ara ##fat can visit ara ##fat but he wo n ' t be allowed to meet senior israeli officials , ' ' said a senior sharon adviser , ra ##ana ##n gi ##ssi ##n .
israel first threatened such a boycott several weeks ago , but enforced it only selective ##ly .
the european union on monday dismissed the decision and a spoke ##sw ##oman said eu leaders will continue to involve ara ##fat in the search for peace .
ara ##fat , who has been confined by israel to the west bank town of rama ##llah for more than a year , accused israel of inc ##iting against him .
` ` not to forget i condemned it completely , these terrorist activities , ' ' ara ##fat said monday in halt ##ing english , speaking before the af ##ula bombing .
` ` at the same time , you should remember ( israel ' s ) inc ##ite ##ment policy against me .
this is to increase the siege around me .
where did it happen that a president was forbidden from moving out of his office ? ' '
the new palestinian prime minister , mahmoud abbas , has denounced violence against israelis , but also told sharon in a weekend meeting - the first israeli - palestinian summit in three years - that he wants to persuade the militants to stop attacks , rather than di ##sar ##m them by force .
the argument over how rein in the militants and halt violence has been holding up implementation of the road map .
the plan calls for parallel steps in the first stage , including a palestinian crack ##down on militants , an israeli troop pull ##back from palestinian towns and a construction freeze in jewish settlements .
sharon insists the palestinians make the first move .
he was to have discussed his objections with u . s . president george w . bush this week , but canceled his trip after sunday ' s bus bombing .
the palestinians have accepted the plan as is .
the latest wave of attacks began saturday evening when a hamas bomber blew himself up in a square in the west bank city of he ##bron , killing an israeli settler and his pregnant wife .
on sunday morning , another hamas ass ##ail ##ant blew up the jerusalem bus and about half an hour later , a third bomber from the group detonated explosives on the outskirts of jerusalem , killing only himself .
israeli analyst mark heller said that ` ` hamas is trying to ensure that the road map does n ' t go anywhere and that abu maze ##n ( abbas ) does n ' t go anywhere either . ' '
the three bombers came from he ##bron and at one point studied at the polytechnic institute in the city .
two bombers , fu ##ad q ##awa ##sm ##eh , 18 , and bass ##em tak ##rou ##ri , 19 , lived in the same he ##bron neighborhood and were friends .
the israeli military on monday demolished the q ##awa ##sm ##eh family home , part of a policy of trying to deter attacks by punish ##ing ass ##ail ##ants ' relatives .
the three bombers released farewell videos , apparently taken in the same wooded area .
in frame grabs published in the ye ##dio ##t ah ##ron ##ot daily , the three struck identical poses , holding up assault rifles . each wore a green head ##band with quran ##ic verses and an olive - colored vest with pockets for ammunition and grenades .
in another development , israeli forensic ##s experts identified a body that washed up on a tel aviv beach last week as that of a brit ##on , omar khan sharif , 27 , the suspected acc ##omp ##lice of a british suicide bomber who blew himself up outside a tel aviv pub april 30 .
two musicians and a waitress were killed in the blast .
sharif also carried explosives , but they did n ' t go off , and he fled . it was not known whether he was hurt at the time .
the identification was made with the help of dna samples supplied to israel ' s forensic ##s institute by british detectives , said the head of the institute , dr . ye ##hu ##da hiss .
he said sharif drowned .

to ##uj ##an fai ##sal , 54 , said she was informed of the refusal by an interior ministry committee overseeing election preparations .
` ` the excuse is invalid because i ' ve been convicted on political not criminal grounds , which does n ' t violate my right for contest ##ing the elections , ' ' fai ##sal told the associated press .
fai ##sal was convicted in may 2002 for publishing false and exaggerated information abroad that harmed the government ' s reputation and dignity .

but after spending 40 days in prison , jordan ' s king abdullah ii pardon ##ed the former legislator known for her harsh criticism of the state .
jordan ' s electoral law ban ##s jordanian ##s from contest ##ing the polls if they were convicted of any crime , except political , and sentenced to more than one year in jail .
government officials were not immediately available for comment .
during fai ##sal ' s 1993 - 97 stint in parliament , she became known as a fierce critic of the government and muslim ex ##tre ##mist ##s and a champion of liberal views in conservative jordan .
she lost her seat in the 1997 election .

australia to keep open its embassy in saudi arabia with bc - me - gen - - saudi - attacks
canberra , australia ( ap )
australia will keep open its embassy in saudi arabia despite decisions by the united states , britain and germany to close their diplomatic outpost ##s in the country amid growing terror fears .
on the eve of a visit to the saudi capital , foreign minister alexander down ##er said security at the australian embassy appeared to be sufficient .
` ` we have quite a substantial security presence at the australian embassy in ri ##yad ##h and the ambassador thinks that that security presence is sufficient , ' ' down ##er told the australian broadcasting corp .
australia is one of washington ' s staunch ##est allies .
canberra sent troops to fight in the war on terror in afghanistan and alongside u . s . and british forces in iraq .
new zealand also has no immediate plans to close its saudi embassy .
on tuesday , saudi security officials said three suspected al - q ##aid ##a militants were arrested in ji ##dda ##h , saudi arabia , in sweeps following the near - simultaneous suicide attacks on three residential compounds on the outskirts of ri ##yad ##h on may 12 .
the bombings killed 34 people _ including nine attackers , eight americans and two brit ##ons _ and wounded nearly 200 others .
earlier this week , saudi and u . s . officials said they had new intelligence pointing to os ##ama bin laden ' s al - q ##aid ##a group possibly launching fresh attacks in the united states or against american interests overseas .

israeli troops kill palestinian boy and in ##jure two other children in west bank violence
jerusalem ( ap )
israeli troops shot and killed a 16 - year - old palestinian boy and critically injured two children , ages 7 and 9 , during conflicts in the west bank that erupted tuesday as israeli and palestinian leaders moved toward talks on a new mid ##ea ##st peace plan .
the shooting ##s _ which the israeli army said came in response to attacks by palestinians throwing stones and mo ##lot ##ov cocktail ##s _ came a day after israeli prime minister ariel sharon declared that israel ' s occupation in the west bank must end , stunning both do ##vish opponents and hard ##line allies .
sharon ' s remarks and israel ' s conditional acceptance sunday of the so - called ` ` road map ' ' to peace were expected to jump - start stalled mid ##ea ##st peace negotiations .
a summit between sharon and his palestinian counterpart , mahmoud abbas , had been planned for wednesday but was postponed , according to israeli and palestinian officials , who blamed each other for the delay .
the officials said no new date had been set ; israel radio said the meeting would take place thursday .
a three - way summit with u . s . president george w . bush could take place as early as next week , possibly in jordan .
israeli soldiers shot and killed a 16 - year - old palestinian boy and wounded a 7 - year - old boy after opening fire at stone throw ##ers in the tu ##lka ##rem refugee camp in the west bank on tuesday , palestinian hospital officials said .
the army said troops fired , and hit a boy , after a palestinian youth threw a mo ##lot ##ov cocktail .
in a village near the west bank city of na ##bl ##us on tuesday , israeli troops opened fire on youths throwing stones , hitting a 9 - year - old palestinian boy in the head and critically wounding him , and hitting two 12 - year - old boys in the legs , lightly wounding them , palestinian hospital officials said .
a 10 - year - old boy was struck in the leg by a rubber bullet , but was not seriously hurt , the officials said .
military sources said troops were trying to break up stone - throwing protests , but did not use live fire .
the army was not aware of any injuries .
five palestinian children , a palestinian woman and a police officer , were injured tuesday after accidentally det ##ona ##ting explosives in the west bank city of he ##bron , palestinian security officials said .
the children found the explosives in two plastic bags under a tree and accidentally detonated the first bag .
after a police officer arrived , the second bag exploded , seriously injuring him , the officials said .
israeli troops killed a palestinian teenager monday and another surrendered after in ##fi ##lt ##rating from gaza , the military said .
they were unarmed and apparently looking for work .
in a village near the west bank town of q ##al ##qi ##li ##ya , an 11 - year - old palestinian boy was killed during an exchange of gunfire .
also monday , israeli soldiers fired on four diplomatic vehicles in the northern gaza town of beit han ##oun , diplomats said .
there were no injuries from the incident .
peter lund ##berg , an official from the swedish consulate in jerusalem , said that two bullets hit the windshield of the swiss consulate ' s armored car , and that small - arms fire also was directed at other cars from sweden , denmark and the european union .
military sources said the israeli army had established road ##block ##s at the entrance to beit han ##oun to prevent palestinians militants from leaving the area .
the sources said shots had been fired in the air when vehicles tried to skirt the road ##block ##s .
the violence erupted after sharon endured with ##ering criticism monday from members of his own li ##ku ##d party over his cabinet ' s acceptance of the u . s . - backed ` ` road map ' ' peace plan .
sharon indicated a 180 - degree turn ##around after decades of warning that an israeli withdrawal from even small parts of the west bank could end ##anger israel ' s existence .
sk ##ept ##ics , however , wondered whether sharon ' s conversion was a sh ##rew ##d effort to def ##le ##ct u . s . pressure in the hopes the road map would fail before israel had to make tough concessions .
` ` to keep 3 . 5 million people under occupation is bad for us and them , ' ' sharon said in remarks broadcast on israel radio .
the term ` ` occupation ' ' is ana ##the ##ma to the israeli right , which believes israel has a legitimate claim to the west bank and gaza strip for religious and security reasons .
palestinians and their do ##vish israeli allies routinely use the word ` ` occupation ' ' when demanding that israel leave the west bank and gaza and di ##sman ##tle jewish settlements .
palestinians claim all of the west bank and gaza for a state .
on sunday , sharon ' s cabinet conditional ##ly approved the ` ` road map , ' ' a three - phase plan that begins with a halt to violence and en ##vis ##ages a palestinian state in the west bank and gaza strip in 2005 .
sharon told party critics he was committed to finding a political solution to the conflict , including an israeli withdrawal from west bank population centers .
` ` this ca n ' t continue endless ##ly .
do you want to remain forever in rama ##llah , jen ##in , na ##bl ##us ? ' '
he asked .
li ##ku ##d law ##makers charged that the road map was slant ##ed in favor of the palestinians and end ##anger ##s israel .
in his remarks monday , sharon left himself an out .
` ` what will happen if palestinian terror continues ?
nothing .
nothing will happen .
the palestinians will get nothing , ' ' he said .
critics have said sharon ' s long - held condition that all violence must stop before peace moves is un ##real ##istic and guarantees failure of any peace initiative , including the road map , thus releasing him from the necessity of following through on his remarks .
liberal law ##maker yo ##ssi sar ##id argued sharon was trying to keep his intentions mu ##rky to persuade the u . s . government that he was committed to the plan , while his hawk ##ish allies could assume he was just making a tactical move to end u . s . pressure .
` ` ariel sharon likes to walk in the fog , because then no one knows where he is headed , ' ' sar ##id wrote in the ye ##dio ##t ah ##ron ##ot daily .

u . s . law ##maker : north korea says it will produce more nu ##kes
seoul , south korea ( ap )
north korea has told american law ##makers it already has nuclear weapons and intends to build more , a senior u . s . congressman said monday after returning from a trip to the communist state .
` ` they admitted to having nuclear capability and weapons at this moment , ' ' said rep . curt we ##ldon , who headed a delegation of u . s . law ##makers that visited p ##yon ##gy ##ang for three days ending sunday .
` ` they admitted to an effort to expand their nuclear production program . ' '
we ##ldon ' s comments echoed those of u . s . officials following talks in beijing in april .
they said that north korea claimed during a pause in the formal talks that it already had nuclear weapons , but would give up the program in return for economic aid and security guarantees .
we ##ldon said at a news conference in seoul that north korean vice foreign minister kim ky ##e g ##wan repeated that claim during a dinner meeting .
both kim and foreign minister pa ##ek nam sun told we ##ldon that p ##yon ##gy ##ang planned to produce more nuclear weapons and had nearly finished rep ##ro ##ces ##sing the spent nuclear fuel rods needed to do so , despite pressure from the united states and its allies .
` ` they admitted to having just about completed the rep ##ro ##ces ##sing of 8 , 000 rods , ' ' said we ##ldon , a republican who is the no . 2 member of a u . s . house panel that oversees the armed forces .
u . s . experts say that rep ##ro ##ces ##sing the rods could give north korea several more nuclear bombs within months .
during their visit to p ##yon ##gy ##ang , we ##ldon ' s delegation also met cho ##e tha ##e bo ##k , chairman of north korea ' s legislature , the supreme people ' s assembly .
although they were not traveling as envoy ##s of u . s . president george w . bush , they were the first american officials to visit since the nuclear stand ##off began in october .
they flew to seoul on sunday to brief south korean officials on their northern trip .
north korea said it was developing its nuclear weapons as ` ` a response to what they saw happened in iraq , with the u . s . removing saddam hussein from power , ' ' we ##ldon said .
a north korean foreign ministry spokesman was quoted as saying by state - run kc ##na news agency that the visit helped both sides better understand each other and they shared the view that washington and p ##yon ##gy ##ang needed to avoid confrontation and exist peacefully .
` ` they were of the same view that it is necessary to seek a negotiated settlement of the nuclear issue and expressed their stand that it is necessary to continue seeking and discussing ways of settling it , ' ' the spokesman said .
north korea has repeatedly accused washington of plan ##ing to invade . bush says he prefers a diplomatic solution , but has not ruled out a military option .
in seoul , south korean president ro ##h mo ##o - hyun said his government has no ` ` clear proof ' ' to conclude north korea has nuclear weapons .
` ` north korea has told important people of the united states that it has developed nu ##kes and rep ##ro ##ces ##sed spent fuel rods .
but north korea has not confirmed that to anyone else , ' ' ro ##h said .
` ` thus , we must make a very careful judgment on whether we will conclude it has nuclear weapons or not , based on those words only . ' '
u . s . and south korean officials say that north korea may be bluff ##ing about its nuclear program in an attempt to extract concessions from the united states .
but u . s . deputy defense secretary paul wolf ##ow ##itz said monday that the threat could n ' t be ignored .
` ` certainly what we know suggests that we should take what they ( north korean officials ) are saying very seriously , ' ' he said at a news conference in seoul .
we ##ldon said his delegation ` ` comes away convinced ' ' that the nuclear stand ##off can be resolved in a peaceful manner that allows p ##yon ##gy ##ang ' s communist regime to stand while removing its nuclear threats .
ro ##h issued a similar message during a nationally televised news conference .
` ` south korea and the united states share a firm principle that north korea should never possess nuclear weapons and that the issue should be resolved through a peaceful manner , ' ' he said .
ro ##h spoke after meeting the u . s . law ##makers and wolf ##ow ##itz , who also arrived in seoul on sunday for a two - day visit to discuss north korea .
wolf ##ow ##itz said saturday in singapore that washington hoped putting pressure on north korea ' s battered economy would resolve the nuclear stand ##off .
on monday , wolf ##ow ##itz stressed that military readiness was just as important .
in meetings with south korean officials , wolf ##ow ##itz urged them to increase military spending on new technologies and telecommunications equipment , as u . s . forces have done .
south korea ear ##marks about us $ 14 . 5 billion for its military .
` ` they still work with paper and pencil instead of with the kind of modern communications gear that our special forces took with them to afghanistan , ' ' wolf ##ow ##itz said .
he said upgrades would allow troops to react quicker to threats from the north and help reduce the possibility of a military conflict on the peninsula , not height ##en it .
the nuclear crisis flared last october when u . s . officials said north korea admitted running a secret nuclear weapons program in violation of a 1994 accord with washington .

state refused bid to prose ##cute acquitted apartheid ge ##rm warfare head
b ##loe ##m ##fo ##nte ##in , south africa ( ap )
south africa ' s supreme court of appeal ruled tuesday against a state request to re ##try the head of apartheid ' s ge ##rm warfare program , once accused of plotting to poison nelson mandela .
wo ##uter bass ##on was acquitted in april 2002 on 46 charges , ranging from murder and drug trafficking to fraud and theft .
bass ##on was accused of directing south africa ' s former apartheid regime ' s bio ##chemical efforts aimed at destroying its opponents .
the ruling by judges pie ##t st ##re ##iche ##r and mohamed na ##vs ##a of the supreme court of appeal , the highest appeals court in the country , means that bass ##on can not be tried again and his ac ##qui ##ttal stands , the south african press association reported .
the state ' s appeal was based on the judge refusing to rec ##use himself during bass ##on ' s 2 1 / 2 - year trial .
the prosecution alleged presiding judge willie hart ##zen ##berg favored bass ##on .
the appeal judges found hart ##zen ##berg ' s refusal did not relate to an error of law on his part .
bass ##on headed a program named project coast in the 1980 ' s .
during the trial witnesses testified that the project involved trying to create deadly bacteria and anti - fertility drugs that would only affect blacks .
they poisoned opponents ' clothing and stock ##pile ##d cholera , hiv and ant ##hra ##x .
the alleged intended victims included former president nelson mandela and several african national congress leaders who are now high - ranking government officials .
he had also been accused of sip ##hon ##ing millions of dollars from project coast to finance a lavish , globe - tr ##otti ##ng lifestyle and of selling drugs .

mars rover is launched on voyage to look for evidence of water
cape can ##aver ##al , florida ( ap )
a rocket holding the first of two mars rovers blasted off tuesday on a seven - month voyage to the red planet where the golf - cart - sized vehicles will search for evidence that there was once enough water to support life on mars .
the rover named spirit lifted off from the cape can ##aver ##al air force station aboard a boeing delta ii rocket at 1 : 58 p . m . ( 1758 gm ##t ) .
thunder ##storm ##s delayed the launch by two days , and launch officials contend ##ed with a last - minute communications g ##lit ##ch between stations that will track the spacecraft .
the second rover , named opportunity , will be launched later this month , and both are expected to arrive at mars in january .
moving on six wheels , the $ 800 million rovers act as robotic geologist ##s .
each is equipped with a pan ##ora ##mic camera , a camera for close - up views of rocks and a drill to cut into rocks .
the data will be transmitted back to earth .
previous missions have shown mars had water in the past , but scientists want to find out how long the water was there and in what quantities .
scientists believe the water may show that mars once was able to support life .
the rovers ' landing sites , on opposite sides of the planet , were chosen for their likelihood of holding evidence of water .
studying the minerals in rocks can tell scientists how the rocks were formed , whether they were ever submerged in water , and whether hot water ever ran over them .
the rovers are expected to travel up to 132 feet ( 39 . 6 meters ) each martian day , which is 24 hours and 39 { minutes long .
the missions are expected to last three months but could run longer . the rovers eventually will shut down as dust builds up on their solar panels and they will remain on the planet .
only 12 out of 30 previous attempts have reached mars , and only three out of nine attempts have succeeded in landing on the planet .
nasa rev ##amp ##ed its mars program after the failure of two unmanned missions to mars four years ago .
the space agency has been under intense scrutiny since february when the space shuttle columbia di ##sin ##te ##grate ##d over texas , killing all seven crew members .
a logo patch of that last columbia mission was attached to both mars rovers .

u . s . likely to wait , reg ##roup before attacking baghdad
04 - 03 - 03 02 : 16 : 00 ##est
by edward epstein
c . 2003 san francisco chronicle
washington _ having punched through severely depleted republican guard divisions that formed baghdad ' s outer defensive ring , u . s . army and marine forces are likely to pause again to test the iraqi capital ' s inner defenses and wa ##all but eva ##por ##ated under the weight of the u . s . assault .
their collapse left the u . s . troops less than 20 miles from saddam hussein ' s capital .
bet ` f ##ow central command chief gen . tommy franks and his field commanders face a big decision _ whether to rush into the city of 5 million where hussein ' s regime has gathered its most - trusted forces or wait and see if the war can be won without paying the price of street - to - street urban fighting .
` ` we are expecting ##n or at least planning for , a very difficult fight ahead , ' '
gen . stanley mcc ##hr ##yst ##al said at the pentagon tuesday .
` ` we are not expecting to drive into baghdad suddenly and seize it . ' '
instead of an all - out assault , analysts expect the united states to follow the example of british forces outside the southern iraqi city of bas ##ra .
they are likely to mount small probing patrols into the city to determine the level of iraqi resistance .
if these patrols meet little opposition , thousands of troops could rush into the city .
if the iraqi ##s respond forcefully , the army and marine units could withdraw and await the 4th mechanized infantry division , which will soon start moving north from kuwait .
while they wait , the forces would try to determine where iraqi strong points are within the city and where hussein might be , if he is still alive .
` ` the bas ##ra model will work for a while , at least until you see problems with food and water for civilians in the city , ' ' said lawrence ko ##rb , an analyst at the council on foreign relations who was assistant defense secretary under former president ronald reagan .
` ` before going in ( with a full assault ) , you have to decide if it ' s worth the risks , and . . . you have to know who ' s there in the way of iraqi forces and the amount of potential damage to civilians , ' ' he said .
the administration has said it wants to minimize casualties to iraqi civilians , which makes the british experience around bas ##ra ins ##truct ##ive , the analysts said .
the british have been outside the city of 1 . 5 million for more than a week .
thousands of refugees have fled the city , apparently providing information to the british that has led to raids on military and ba ##ath party sites in the city .
` ` the key end ##game may be whether the u . s . can par ##se out the key regime centers of power in baghdad and attack them without having to fight into the city , or at least locate them well enough to atm ##an of the center for strategic and international studies said in his daily war report .
u . s . st ##rate ##gist ##s say that hussein , if he is still alive and in control of his forces , might like a bloody battle in baghdad because such fighting could cause heavy u . s . casualties .
his last hope for survival might be that the united states loses its taste for such losses and forces president bush to negotiate a compromise that would allow hussein and his family to keep power in baghdad .
but michael o ' han ##lon of the brook ##ings institution in washington said the apparent collapse of republican guard resistance could de ##pr ##ive hussein of much of the wall ##op he was counting on in the city .
` ` if u . s . forces seriously de ##grade iraq ' s half - dozen republican guard divisions before that final battle , and only have to face perhaps 30 , 000 special republican guard , fed ##ay ##een , and related personnel , the task will not be as hard as it might have been , ' ' he said .
while two guard divisions have apparently been smashed , there are three others in the baghdad area .
a sixth remains in northern iraq .
cord ##es ##man said it seems the guards have been reinforced by units from the regular iraqi army , which is generally viewed as less reliable . this shows the iraqi military ' s growing weakness , he said .
` ` the republican guard has taken a massive hammering at every level and is now scattered and deploy ##ing somewhat erratic ##ally at the brigade level , ' ' he said .
the iraqi ##s still have n ' t used chemical weapons , even though many experts feared such attacks as the u . s . troops neared baghdad .
ko ##rb , who ' s convinced hussein has stocks of chemical weapons he never reported to u . n . inspectors , said he would n ' t be surprised if hussein tried to use them .
but he also said , ` ` he may destroy them to em ##bar ##ras ##s us , ' ' to show the world he never had such weapons and that bush invaded for no reason other than aggression .
the u . s . forces zero ##ing in on baghdad _ the 1st marine division from the east and the army ' s 3rd mechanized infantry division _ are trained in urban warfare .
but in such close - quarters fighting , they would lose much of the technological advantage of their air supremacy , which would have to be curt ##ailed because bombing in a city can cause large civilian casualties .
however , baghdad from the air looks like los angeles _ wide , straight boulevard ##s intersect ##ed by side streets in a grid pattern .
` ` our forces would be capable of dealing with it reasonably .
but there would be lots of casualties on all sides , ' ' ko ##rb said .

cia says north korea has new nuclear testing site and technology
washington
u . s . intelligence officials now believe north korea is developing the technology to make nuclear war ##heads small enough to fit atop the country ' s growing arsenal of miss ##ides ( potentially putting tokyo and u . s . troops based in japan at risk , according to officials who have received the intelligence reports .
in the assessment , which they have shared with japan , south korea and other allies in recent weeks , officials at the central intelligence agency said that u . s . satellites have identified a sophisticated new nuclear testing site in an area called young ##do ##kt ##ong .
at the site , equipment has been set up to test conventional explosives that , when detonated , could com ##press a pluto ##nium core and set on ##fe nuclear explosion .
[ om ##a intelligence officials believe that the existence of the testing range is evidence that the country intends to manufacture much more sophisticated weapons that would be light enough to put onto its growing arsenal of medium - and long - range missiles .
previously , u . s . officials had said they were uncertain whether north korea had received enough outside technical help to even attempt to make such a ` ` mini ##at ##urized ' ' nuclear war ##head .
the new testing capability would suggest that the north koreans are getting closer _ now , officials said , the intelligence reports say they could do in in as little as a year or less .
but officials say there is no sure way of knowing that they can until they actually test one .
senior administration officials say that washington has been trying to convince asia ##gent that it requires a unified diplomatic front to force the country to give up its weapons .
the new intelligence is apparently being marshal ##ed to support the administration ' s argument .
according to officials who have been brief ##ed on the u . s . reports , conventional explosions sim ##ulating a nuclear det ##ona ##tion have been set off at the testing site , which is near north korea ' s main nuclear complex .
north korea has never tested a nuclear weapon , though the cia long ago estimated that it manufactured two crude devices in the late 1980s or early 1990s .
north korea , unlike iraq , has made no secret of its plan to develop nuclear weapons .
now , administration officials say they fear that the country is on the verge of producing five or six new weapons , some of which might be mini ##at ##urized .
` ` this would give them the range they never had before , and the chance to spread their threat far beyond south korea , ' ' said one senior asian official , noting that approximately 60 , 000 u . s . troops are based in japan .
` ` it changes the dynamics of the problem . ' '
the new intelligence estimates provided to asian allies , however , left it unclear how quickly the north could produce the small war ##heads .
the worst - case estimate , officials say , is that they could do so in less than a year .
( story can end here .
optional material follows . )
u . s . satellites have been watching north korean nuclear activity intently since late last year , when the north evicted international inspectors .
those inspectors had stood guard over a collection of 8 , 000 spent nuclear fuel rods , which can be rep ##ro ##ces ##sed into weapons - grade pluto ##nium .
in january the country began to re - start its nuclear rex ##ro ##ges ##sing equipment , which had been moth ##ball ##ed for nearly a decade under a 1994 agreement with the clinton administration .
but according to u . s . officials , it now appears that north korean engineers ran into technical problems in restart ##ing the facilities .
while intelligence officials have reached no consensus , they told allies last week that in the worst case , only a few hundred of the 8 , 000 rods had been converted into pluto ##nium .
it would take 1 , 000 to 1 , 500 rods to make enough pluto ##nium for a weapon , experts say .
o
` ` what we are told is that it would take perhaps six months after that to produce a mini ##at ##urized war ##head , and put it into one of the missiles , ' ' said one senior official who has recently reviewed the intelligence .
` ` but after iraq , who knows how good those estimates are ? ' '
after the claims made about prohibited weapons in iraq , which have not been found so far , skepticism about the quality of u . s . intelligence is widespread .
and in the case of north korea , as in iraq , the im ##media ##cy of the threat depends on whose analysis seems most compelling .
so far , u . s . intelligence has picked up almost no sign of the tell ##tale k ##ry ##pton gas that is released into the atmosphere when nuclear fuel rods are converted into weapons - grade pluto ##nium .
this has led some analysts to argue that the north koreans may be farther from producing a weapon than feared a few months ago .
but others note that trucks were seen carrying the rods out of their normal storage area months ago , and it is unclear where they are _ or even whether the united states is sniffing for the k ##ry ##pton gas in the right place .
` ` we do n ' t believe that the main rep ##ro ##ces ##sing facility has been very active , ' ' said one senior administration official in a recent interview .
` ` but could there be a second rep ##ro ##ces ##sor ?
no one knows for sure . ' '
without question , though , north korea ' s capabilities greatly outs ##trip anything iraq has had in the past decade , and north korea ' s program is probably several years ahead of iran ' s .
president bush and south korea ' s new president , ro ##h mo ##o - h is unclear whether they interpret the meaning of that phrase the same way .
bush has said he wants a diplomatic solution to the problem , but would not fore ##cl ##ose any option , including military options .
ro ##h has said any pre - em ##ptive strike against the north ' s nuclear facilities could prove disastrous .

chinese agencies suspend middle east tours due to war risk
beijing , march 14 ( xi ##nh ##ua )
most beijing travel agencies have suspended tourist trips to the middle east as tension height ##ens in the gulf region , thursday ' s beijing youth daily reports .
out of security concerns , major travel agencies , including the china international travel service , china travel service and china youth tourism service , have temporarily suspended tours to egypt and turkey for chinese tourists .
according to dun ji ##dong of the china travel service , once war breaks out between the united states and iraq , not only will middle east travel routes be frozen but the entire overseas travel business will be affected .
the only few travel agencies still organizing visits to the middle east have increased their prices by 500 to 600 yuan ( 60 to 72 us dollars ) .
an 8 - day visit to egypt and turkey , for instance , has increased to 12 , 500 yuan ( 1 , 50 ##6 us dollars ) .
according to a staff member with one travel agency still doing middle east business , the increases reflect the rise in oil prices and the increased difficulty in getting visas .
asked about the possible war , he said , if tours were curt ##ailed because of a war emergency , the agency would ref ##und the portion of the costs covering the remainder of the trip .

round ##up : uk , us down ##play divide on un role in post - war iraq
belfast , britain , april 8 ( xi ##nh ##ua )
a two - day summit between british prime minister tony blair and us president george w . bush ended here tuesday with both countries trying to minimize splits on un role in rebuilding iraq after the ongoing us - led war against the country is over .
as the us - led coalition troops are reportedly thrusting into baghdad and the second iraqi city of bas ##ra , blair and bush agreed there would be a " vital role " for the united nations in post - war iraq .
during their first war summit on march 27 at camp david , blair and bush became divided over what a role the united nations will play in postwar iraq , when bush gave no positive reaction to blair ' s suggestion of a strong un role .
after the camp david talks , blair , who analysts say has been pursuing a special relationship with washington in order to restore britain ' s traditional role as a transatlantic " bridge " , was forced to read ##just his tone .
blair and bush were expected to bridge their gap on the issue by reaching an agreement on un role in post - war iraq , some analysts said even before this summit at hillsborough , south of belfast , the second of its kind since the war broke out on march 20 .
in a joint written statement , the two allies pledged to seek un security council resolutions to af ##firm iraq ' s territorial integrity , ensure aid delivery and end ##ors ##e an " appropriate " post - conflict administration for iraq .
" we welcome the appointment by the united nations secretary - general of a special adviser for iraq to work with the people of iraq and coalition representatives , " the statement added .
the united nations would have a " vital role " in the effort to repair iraq ' s infrastructure , blair told reporters at a news conference after his talks with bush , down ##play ##ing un role in emphasizing that ultimately the country must be run by the iraqi people .
" the key is that iraq in the end should be governed by the iraqi people , " blair said , pl ##edging that british and us forces would not stay in the country " a day longer than necessary " .
it was a " false choice " to debate whether iraq should be run by coalition forces or the united nations , said blair , who was believed to be in favor of a stronger un role in post - conflict iraq than bush .
echoing blair , bush said the un would play a role in all aspects of post - war iraq , from humanitarian aid to a future interim authority , adding that iraq would " move as quickly as possible " to an interim authority made up of iraqi ##s from inside and outside the country .
however , when pressed on what precisely the un role would be , bush on tuesday mentioned only humanitarian work , " suggesting " people to staff the interim authority and helping iraq " progress . "
" when we say vital role for the united nations , we mean vital role for the united nations in all aspects of the issue , whether it be humanitarian aid , or whether it be helping to stand up an interim authority .
the iraqi people will decide who ' s on the iraqi interim authority , " said bush .
bush did not spell out how much power the united nations would have , nor did he elaborate on washington ' s plans to place us officials alongside iraqi ##s in the interim administration .
differences still remain between the united states and britain , analysts said , over the speed with which iraq should be handed to an interim iraqi administration , and the extent to which a us - led group of generals and former diplomats should effectively run the country .
yet , analysts argued , both britain and the united states hope their agreed vision of a postwar scenario will pl ##aca ##te anti - war nations such as france , germany and russia .
" we will move as quickly as possible to place governmental responsibilities under the control of an interim authority composed of iraqi ##s from both inside and outside the country , " bush vowed at the joint news conference with blair , adding that the interim authority would serve until a permanent government could be chosen by the iraqi people .
" rebuilding of iraq will require the support and expertise of the international community .
we are committed to working with international institutions , including the united nations , which will have a vital role to play in this task , " bush added .
blair also pleaded the world to avoid " endless diplomatic wr ##ang ##les " over the future of iraq like the international dispute over a second un resolution on iraq that preceded the war .
france and germany , which were most vocal in opposing this us - led war against iraq , have been insisting that the united nations should play a central role in the phase of post - war iraq .
on the un ##res ##olved dispute between europe and the united states , analysts say , blair might again have to make a difficult choice , but he is very likely to support the united states , which britain can not afford to fall out with .

but the order just released from the courthouse in new york has obviously separated wa ##ks ##al ' s good efforts in making new drugs from his legal problems .
amid the financial storms last year and the ensuing cracking down on corporate mal ##fe ##asa ##nce , wa ##ks ##al pleaded guilty in october to charges involving his efforts to sell a huge block of his company ' s stock in late 2001 .
the attempt to sell the shares were just before im ##cl ##one shares plunged on the news that the food and drug administration rejected im ##cl ##one ' s application to sell the experimental cancer drug , er ##bit ##ux .
this incident then triggered legal investigations , which also included the case of a us media and domestic design diva , martha stewart .

china to build nuclear - powered des ##ali ##nator project
jin ##an , june 24 ( xi ##nh ##ua )
china late this year will start building a nuclear - powered des ##ali ##nator project in yan ##tai city in east china ' s shandong province , with a designed capacity of producing 52 million tons of fresh water a year .
officials with the development planning commission of the shandong provincial government said the project , to be built in cooperation with qing ##hua university , would alleviate water shortages in the city and other parts of the shandong peninsula .
yan ##tai and other parts of shandong suffered acute water shortages due to drought ##s in recent years , changing climate and other reasons .
approved by the state development and reform commission , the project is expected to cost 1 . 6 billion yuan ( nearly 200 million us dollars ) .
zhang zu ##oy ##i , director of the nuclear energy technology and design institute attached to qing ##hua university , was quoted in monday ' s beijing evening news as saying the fresh water to be produced from the project will cost 3 . 75 yuan per ton , much less than the cost of water from existing sources .
the project is expected to use a 200 - mega ##wat ##t nuclear - powered reactor designed by the institute , according to the paper .
the project would be completed and operational in 2007 , it said .

biography of jo - ann bell ##ucci
my biography changed completely 5 years ago when i contracted a very severe case of fi ##bro ##my ##al ##ga .
usually i say nothing about it although it has se ##ver ##ly limited my life , no truth ##ly changed it completely !
this time i decided to just say it up front and go back and talk about the good old days , when life was a kick !
i now live in water ##town , ma , 12 miles from boston ' s logan airport , in a lovely two family house i bought as an investment with my boss , my 9 year old yorkshire terri ##er , teddy !
i just turned 50 years old this christmas .
when i had a j . o . b .
i ran a software company for a few years and then started my own company , pinnacle business enterprises and was under a 5 year exclusive contract with price ##water ##ho ##uo ##se ##co ##opers doing a lot of interesting things like business process engineering , processes but mostly people and the effect new process would have on them . showing them how to invite change into their lives because it freed them from the mu ##nda ##nne tasks and allowed them to use their great creativity instead of their backs .
i ' ll get on to the more fun stuff ( read embarrassing , tea ##sable stuff ) in a minute but just one business story .
those of you in louis ##ian ##na are very familiar with what used to be the ak ##zo salt mines .
on a client visit one day , unexpectedly , they dressed me up in safety equipment and ran me down the mine shaft .
i mention this because i never really got over , after that , how much we take advantage of ev ##ry ##day things . . . like the salt on our tables or the rock salt that keeps the northern cities moving in the winter !
after i learned how to breath with my emergency app ##arat ##ice i was driven around to see the manufacturing sites .
i ' m sure we are all familiar with those yellow ton ##ka trucks little boys play with and move dirt from one place to another . . . .
well just imagine an entire underground city with a variety of those types of trucks ( era ##th move ##rs , back ##hoe ##s etc ) except the tires alone are 8 foot tall !
its then that i realized that life is ever so much more then you can see on the surface in all aspects !
ok chris . . . here comes the stuff you can pay me back with .
i am an excellent dancer , started before i could walk .
i ' ve studied ballet , tap , toe , jazz and modern and studied opera singing for a while .
due to the medications necessitated by my illness , i have lost 150 lbs twice , and in between illnesses , i modelled for several of both trend ##y and elegant boutique and department stores as well as did runway work . one day i ' ll show you my portfolio .
i grew up in what at that time was rural nj and my father was an avid hunter and sportsman .
my father , way ahead of his time in his thinking , was an equal op ##ort ##unt ##y think ##er . . . that is why i can and love to shoot sk ##eet , was a champion archer as a child , learned to camp and hike and drive a speed ##boat , kay ##ack of course canoe and when i recover chris , i will join you white wat ##her raf ##ing because i have only done level three but what an unbelievable rush ! !
i love to craft , i knit , cr ##oche ##t , make furniture , paint and garden .
i consider myself and " all american girl " when that was n ' t a politically incorrect phrase to use .
i am single , and i teach religious education to teenagers as a challenge and as service to god . . . but mostly because they are some of the most interesting , difficult people you can teach . . . but i love them and once you teach them , they are gold .
both my houses , in nj and boston are always open to friends and those who would be friends .
and now i ' ll stop because i can see chris getting ready to give me the hook .
my contact info : jo - ann bell ##ucci j ##bell ##u . . . @ com ##cast . net 88 ##8 - 61 ##6 - 340 ##4 - follows me no matter where i am .

the palestinians want land to live on , while sharon wants no palestinians living on the land .
when the world finally grows the balls to critic ##ize israeli terrorism , we ' ll see peace .
but as long as " criticism is anti - semi ##tism " is the mental ##ity , do n ' t act surprised that the palestinians object to the le ##ben ##sr ##au ##m ( a / k / a settlements ) and israeli terrorism ( bombings , shooting farmers in their fields , bull ##do ##zing crops , destroying schools , shooting children , etc . etc .
etc . ) .

re : good morning iraq
let ' s see . . .
there two main qualities to be desired in a commander - in - chief , generals ##hip and leadership .
because in the united states the commander - in - chief is a purely political post , generals ##hip is usually undertaken by the generals proper under the commander - in - chief , provided it is understood that the commander - in - chief is ultimately responsible and accountable for the outcomes of his general ' s generals ##hip .
generals ##hip involves the technical skills of intelligence gathering , strategic and tactical planning , and the communication of orders .
leadership can be less rigid ##ly defined and is concerned less with coordination than motivation and how a commander seeks to inspire his men to fight harder and endure worse pri ##vation ##s in order to beat the enemy .
president bush generals ##hip has proven def ##icient .
his planning for the war was inadequate and his monitoring of the war after the invasion failed to correct course in the face of the change in circumstances brought by a strong and unexpected insurgency .
the commander - in - chief ' s generals ##hip can su ##ffi ##ce to mo ##tiv ##ate men if they are hi ##gly confident that he is a very capable and skilled general . eisenhower was in that position .
that has not been the case with president bush , who unleashed hell acting on faulty intelligence , failed to find any w ##md , and left our boys at war wanting for armor . that is not the sort of generals ##hip that on rational grounds alone mo ##tiv ##ates men to march to possible death .
men un ##mot ##ivated by bad generals ##hip can still be motivated by exceptional leadership .
in theory , motivation is best carried out by a commander fighting alongside his men .
make no mistake , even when we do n ' t desire a president with a preference for personal combat , the need for a commander to be seen to share dangers with his men is as imperative today as it was in times of alexander of mace ##don .
that ' s why we look at the military record of our leaders .
john kennedy , george h . bush , and even john kerry , the loser , had distinguished military careers that were apt substitutes for leading men in battle . the knowledge that the commander - in - chief once faced grave danger in war brave ##ly can be the an ##imating spirit of troops facing the same dangers .
george w . bush has no distinguished military career .
in fact , cbs and carrier landings notwithstanding , there is every indication that in the peak of youth he avoided the dangers of war as much as he could .
that is not the sort of leadership that on emotional grounds alone mo ##tiv ##ates men to march to possible death .
some might say that george w . bush is neither a general nor a soldier , he is a politician .
he is in charge of grand strategy and he delegates the rest .
true .
but as commander - in - chief he is the ultimate general and the first soldier .
george w . bush , the politician , is not very good at grand strategy either .
the aim of grand strategy is a prosperous and secure peace , and by his several blu ##nder ##s over the psychology of his opponents , the political and economic effects of his actions , and the failure to er ##rad ##icate terrorism and even capture he most wanted terrorist , george w . bush , he has failed to realize the aim of grand strategy .
i ' ll be glad if iraq becomes a truly democratic country .
but will it ? and at what price ?
are you willing to pay with a deficit of billions , thousands of americans dead or badly wounded , and the un ##me ##asurable disruption that a foreign war causes to the life of our nation at all levels , for each country in the world that is in the grip of a tyrant ? i am not .
let those countries grow a generation with the guts and the willingness to originate democratic change and i ' ll support joining other nations to back the e ##f .
but un ##ila ##tera ##lly , or worse leading a coalition featuring ty ##ran ##nies , effect such change remains a bad idea , iraq ' s elections notwithstanding .
george w . bush did n ' t do well in the industrial private sector where success is measured by return on investment .
government suits such a man perfectly ; there is no balance sheet to worry about .
there is every indication that the new rulers of iraq will do business as usual under a democratic var ##nish .
the interim government did n ' t hesitate to torture opponents , just like saddam did .
the shi ##ites will be no different .
that will be our return on investment .
iraq wi ##eld ##s democracy like britney spears wi ##eld ##s the electric guitar , it looks cool and trend ##y but she has no idea of how to play it .

there is a lady by the name of irene so ##ko ##las that is selling on e ##bay under various names .
she is saying she ' s a member of the ua ##cc .
she is selling forge ##ries .
i have contacted the ua ##cc and told them about it so they can check the auction ##s ( she ' s been doing this a long time ) and to tell me if she ' s actually a registered member .
i would suggest everyone read the body of the entire item they ' re bidding on .
everything .
if you see her name , stay clear .
no matter which id she ' s using .
also , i have seen in the past , others res ##elling items us ##uing her coa ' s .
be careful .
i am mi ##ffed the ua ##cc would not check into people before allowing them to be members if in fact she is a member .
but i will reserve judgement till they respond .
this makes one really skeptical .
but if you see a ua ##cc member on e ##bay , do n ' t automatically assume they are leg ##it .
contact the ua ##cc before buying and ask if they are a member .
if you suspect something is fake , do not take it for granted it ' s leg ##it because a ua ##cc number is attached to it .
in cases where the member claims and is a ua ##cc member , still question and then if you suspect there are a number of fake ##s by that person , do not hesitate to let the ua ##cc and e ##bay know .
hope i spared someone here of potential grief and saved someone some money !

" minutes after a massive earthquake rocked the indian ocean on sunday , international ocean monitors knew that a tsunami would likely follow .

lad ##ou ##ce says e - mail ##s were dispatched to indonesian officials , but he does n ' t know what happened to the information . "
it looks more like the indonesian officials were n ' t sitting at their computer or did n ' t have their email client set for 10 minute checks for new mail .

re : indonesia warned about tsunami ##s
on the other hand , if you were a scientist at no ##aa and were into saving people from tsunami ##s , you would think you might have figured out beforehand who you might call if you did get some advanced warning of such an event .
also , the indonesian government probably had no idea that no ##aa could give them advanced warning of tsunami ##s so how could they know they should set up a hot ##line .
so it cuts both ways , the indonesian government should have done some prior planning , but so too should the no ##aa scientists .
you can bet they are figuring out who they should have call next time . - - bill " 20 / 20 hind ##sight " asher

it ' s not the responsibility of no ##aa to set up hot ##lines to governments around the world .
the indonesian government should have contacted the u . s . state department and provided u . s . officials with the contact info .

one bit of tri ##via that has been asked a lot concerns meg ' s ' ethnicity ' .
well , for the longest time this was a topic she and her sister jennifer seemed to avoid , but a few months back , jennifer announced to the world that their father is chinese .
so , that should answer all of those questions .
personally it has never made much difference to me - she is who and what she is !

re : christopher reeve could have died from an allergic reaction
lovely , she refuses an autopsy which could prove how her husband died , but then she turns around and makes accusations like this against his treatment , and in effect , his doctors .
this makes me super pissed off .
the sy ##pm ##tom ##s of a massive allergic reaction and of a systemic infection are completely different .
yet suddenly , she ' s an expert .
statements like this on shows like op ##rah , who loves to spread medical ignorance , are completely ir ##res ##pon ##sible .

re : christopher reeve could have died from an allergic reaction
i did n ' t see this as an accusation but an explanation .
people can have allergic reactions to med ##s they have n ' t reacted to before without anyone knowing it will happen .
it ' s the exposure to the substance that causes the all ##ergy to form .
like people walking through poison ivy half their lives then suddenly having a bad reaction to it .
like the thousands of people developing all ##er ##gies to late ##x these days , etc .
i saw that show and did n ' t think she was accusing anyone of anything , more trying to explain to people why he died so suddenly .
she mentioned several times how wonderful his doctors and nurses and therapist ##s have been and mentioned them by name .

re : christopher reeve could have died from an allergic reaction
there were no accusations by her .
she said there were a couple of drugs that they had used with chris in the past to treat his infections with no problems , and they would use them again and he would have an allergic reaction .
it happens a lot .
she said she did n ' t want an autopsy because there was no blame , she knew it was just his body shutting down .
drugs he was n ' t allergic to in the past would suddenly cause massive problems when they tried to use them for a new infection . she had nothing but praise and gratitude for all his doctors , nurses and care give ##rs .

re : christopher reeve could have died from an allergic reaction
again , a true allergic reaction and an infection have different symptoms . she ' s saying all the doctors and other professionals are wrong and she is right .
also , if any drug causes adverse effects , those effects are supposed to be reported to the fda so future drug users can be alerted to po ##sible consequences .
if she true ##ly believed what she was saying ( and wan ' t just talking out of her ass and probably displaying her denial about her husband ' s illness ) she would allow proper data to be gathered so it could be used to help others .

christopher reeve had a rare disorder called mast ##oc ##yt ##osis .
drug sen ##sit ##iv ##ities are one of the difficulties of that disorder . since they knew he had it , that ' s probably why she ' s not questioning this issue .
i often wondered how he was doing with all the med ##s because of his illness , which developed before his para ##ly ##zing accident .
it ' s actually a testament to his st ##amina and his doctors that he was able to survive as long as he did with this disorder com ##pl ##ica ##ting his care .

re : christopher reeve could have died from an allergic reaction
i ' m not sure about this disagreement you are speaking of between her version and the doctors version of his cause of death .
maybe the dr . s had h ##yp ##oth ##es ##ized possibilities at the time of death and in the months since then , they may thought of other reasons i do n ' t know .
i know about allergic reactions and med ##s , i ' ve been a nurse for 20 years .
and i get a little defensive myself when a hear a lay ##person ( although she probably had more knowledge than most about her husband ' s diagnosis and treatment ) talking like an expert on tv without knowing all the details .
but as i said , i saw the show and did not get that feeling at all that she was being in any way acc ##usa ##tory or blaming .
she also was not coming off as a know - it - all .
this part of the interview was very off - hand and informal feeling , more like go ##sh , i do n ' t think we ' ll ever know , maybe it was this , it could have been that .
it was more that she knew many people cared about her husband and wanted to know what his last hours were like .
i know not everyone is en ##th ##ral ##led with dana reeve , but she had won many people ' s respect .
people are interested to know how she ' s doing after having lost such a big part of her life , and this really was more what the interview was about .

one of the hallmark ##s of a good total ##itarian leader is the tendency to jump into a military uniform at the drop of a hat ( although stuffing socks in your crotch while doing it is an innovation apparently dreamed up by george w . bush ) .
another is to make sure there are plenty of very big pictures of yourself all over the place .
fortunately for our great leader he does n ' t have to do this himself , because he ' s got one of the biggest media companies in the country to do it for him .
clear channel - home to rush limb ##au ##gh and sean han ##nity - owns over 1 , 200 radio stations and 57 television stations in america .
they also own a lot of billboard ##s .
want to know what they do with their billboard ##s when nobody ' s paying to use them ?
the picture was taken off i - 4 north of downtown orlando by due ##r da ##v ##hill .
the text at the bottom reads , " not authorized by any candidate or candidate ' s committee .
a political public service message brought to you by clear channel . "
did you know that one of the largest media companies in the country was in the business of bringing you " political public service messages ? "
me either .
truth be told we originally thought that this picture was fake , but we had to eat crow when clear channel released a statement which read in part , " clear channel outdoor markets are operated locally .
local managers determine what copy to use when a location has time that is not sold to an ad ##vert ##iser . "
that statement was made after clear channel denied the billboard existed , of course .

bush administration quietly stops destroying chemical and biological weapons
unnoticed by anyone else , the bush administration has quietly ditch ##ed programs to destroy america ' s biggest - in - the - world stock ##pile of chemical and biological weapons .
eight places in the us are used to stock ##pile chemical weapons - - including b ##list ##er agents , riot agents , and the dread ##ed nerve agents .
in these eight locations , hundreds of thousands of artillery rounds , bombs , and rockets are stacked in both open and bunker storage , some of them leaking their contents and all of the very deadly .
storage locations include : - - ann ##isto ##n army depot , ann ##isto ##n , al - - rocky mountain arsenal , pueblo , co - - bluegrass army depot , lexington , ky - - aberdeen proving grounds , md - - toe ##lle army depot , toe ##lle , ut ( the grand ##dad ##dy of them all )
destruction is underway in ann ##isto ##n where the dept of defense built and is operating an inc ##iner ##ator to burn weapons located there .
plans were underway to build destruction facilities at all other locations but now the bush junta has removed from its proposed defense budget for fiscal year 2006 all but the minimum funding for these destruction projects . plans to destroy chemical weapons are now stopped , except for a small test program at toe ##lle .
contractors ( be ##cht ##el was the main contractor ) have been told to stop all design and construction work and the re - assign their people - - the destruction programs are dead . )
can anyone spell " w . m . d . " ?
can anyone tell me which nation in the world owns the most w ##md ?
( hint : it ' s neither iraq , iran , nor north korea - - none of the famous " axis of evil . " )
you do n ' t suppose they have stopped destroying these weapons because they plan to use them ?

the old wedding problem
two of my nephew ##s were excluded from their brother ' s wedding this weekend because they are not lds .
of interest , neither went to the reception either .
both were extremely hurt , particularly since they know their brother could have had a civil ceremony and then been married in the temple later .
i was offended because one of those nephew ##s and i are very close , and he was really upset .
the groom said " it was n ' t quite what i had expected . " the bride is not quite able to speak in front of strangers , so i do n ' t know what she thought . she did tell my niece that she thought her husband was a good catch - - rm attending byu and all that .
i got a sort of an ic ##ky feeling when i realized the only people who did attend the kid ' s wedding was his un ##med ##icated bi - polar mother and his father , who suffers from alzheimer ##s . - - regards , lee , the james , um , feminist

re : the old wedding problem
that ' s sad , lee .
i really think it ' s time for the church to admit that a civil ceremony followed by a temple sealing reaches the same goal , often in a more loving way , than insisting that only the sealing is worth doing .
a change of that sort would be very simple to implement , and most church members would like it better than allowing non - lds family members into the temple , which would actually be my preference .
there ' s been a thread recently in one of the ex ##mo for ##a about a woman whose bishop , who she had been planning to have marry her , was going out of town , so she asked the stake president , who she did n ' t know well .
he insisted that he needed to make the point , as part of performing the ceremony , that she really needed to be married in the temple , even though her fiance was not lds .
she ultimately declined his services .
how to get the message across to young people that considering the feelings of their family is just as important as being sealed for time and all eternity ?
i do n ' t know .
it would have to be some sort of grassroots movement , i think , since it ' s not likely to come through official , correlated channels .

re : the old wedding problem
* shrugs *
i chose to have a civil ceremony largely because my wife and i were both converts and a temple ceremony would have excluded both families completely .
from a family stand ##point it sounded lie ##k a good decision , harmony and all that . . . plus the temple ceremony could be sealed a year later .
unfortunately we started off on the wrong foot for a lot of reasons and the marriage did n ' t last .
i ca n ' t help but wonder if perhaps we did ourselves a di ##ser ##vic ##e by not getting sealed ##i nt ##ial ##ly , and making our marriage a gospel focused one .
who ' s to say .
it ' s a tough decision to make and despite the feeling i myself cave ##d i feel people should be understanding of the rational ##e .
for my part if we had been sealed int ##ial ##ly there simply would n ' t have been anyone there and both our families had harsh feel ##ign ##s about the church as is , and a seal ##ign would have only created more dish ##arm ##ony .
for my part though , i think we started the marriage with a compromise and dei ##ned ourselves tremendous blessing and ultimately paid the price .

re : the old wedding problem
hmm . . . i wonder how many success stories are out there from people who chose to have a civil ceremony , and went on later to be happily sealed .
i know that was what happened with my own parents , largely because their decision to get married and my father ' s decision to join the church came very close together , and they did n ' t want to wait the year until he would be able to enter the temple .
they ' re still together after more than 55 years .

divorce is really stupid . . .
i think divorce is really stupid .
it ' ll take me awhile to get to thought stream that got me to that thought today .
first off , i ' m remarried , divorced 3 years ago .
i love my wife , and the kids get along just fine .
i do n ' t like my ex ##wife .
but there was a time when i did like her ; in fact i loved her very much in spite of her numerous flaws , chief among those flaws is that she ' s a na ##rc ##ici ##sts . but we all have some sort of personality problems . . . .
my wife belongs to a support group , and just for fun , they all google ##d their hub ##bies ex ' s .
somehow , this lead me to goo ##gling my ex ' s boyfriend , call him b . and there he was , talking about plans with his wife and kids .
wow .
to me , b was just this one dimensional guy that was being dragged along by my ex ##wife .
now , he turns out to have a 3 dimensional life too .
i guess we all do .
i ' d like to take him out for a beer sometime .
it would be fun .
i wonder what happen ##ned to b ' s son ?
my kids never mentioned b having a son .
b ' s son is apparently 16 years old , same age as my daughter .
i wonder if b had a huge messy divorce , and his ex took the kid out of state .
my ex threatened that .
ou ##ch .
divorce really sucks .
i have my kids almost 50 / 50 these days , but it was a huge messy post divorce compromise that took a year to complete .
i wonder if b had to go through some of the same kind of shit ?
perhaps my ex ##wife has more sympathy for what its like to be a guy on the receiving end of a divorce now ?
ok , keep goo ##gling .
oh my , the plot thick ##ens .
i found b ' s ex ##wife . very art ##iculate writer .
this is really humorous .
she wrote an article about a divorce support group , ending it with something about mrs . b being happily married but she ' s impressed by the divorce support group . and that was only 4 years ago !
mr . and mrs . b had a real life too . they shared dreams together , raised a kid , and probably had a lot of fun together .
now i ' m even more curious about the b ' s kid .
she still lives in town here .
maybe there was some sort of terrible tragedy ? ? ? i ' ll have to ask about b ' s kid when my own kids switch off next week .
sometimes we want to see marriage one dimensional ##ly .
either its bad or good .
that ' s total bullshit .
i know my first marriage had a lot of good adventures , a lot of friendship , a lot of love .
oh , yeah , it was n ' t perfect .
my ex ##wife is a total pain in the ass much of the time , and i tried to let her do what she wanted , sometimes i could n ' t .
but , even to the end , we loved each other .
and now , i see the lost family ties .
she ' s lost my family , i ' m slowly drifting out of touch with her family .
we both build new lives .
new lives .
but you know , as long as the kids are shared , you ca n ' t total get this ex ##sp ##ouse out of your mental psyche .
they say it takes one year for every two that you were married .
i believe that .
meanwhile , life goes on .
my wife ' s name is m . we ' re going to a bed and breakfast this weekend , to get away , relax .
m and i are slowly building a history of our own together .
we share adventures together , we share adventure with my kids , and with our dogs .
and , i take lots of pictures .
i really have n ' t changed very much from who i was before . although , the dog thing is really post divorce .
lots and lots of pictures .
sometimes i look at the old photos , before divorce .
we smiled together , laughed , hugged .
i was one of the first digital camera users , and i have too many photos from my first marriage . sometimes i feel like i ' m racing to create enough photos of my new life to out ##weig ##h the long history of my first life .
that ' s going to take awhile . . . luckily , we flawed human beings live long lives , and digital cameras take lots and lots of pictures !
if my ex ##wife does n ' t dump b , maybe they ' ll wind up staying together , maybe even getting married .
i think that would be nice .
and they too will begin the process of rebuilding their " together " lives .
i ' m assuming there is some humanity beneath my ex ##wife ' s na ##rc ##ici ##stic shell , but i do believe there is .
b seems like a decent enough person too . so , b and my ex will be doing the same thing that i ' m doing . rebuilding their lives .
anyway , all of this gets me back to my original point .
divorce seems really really stupid .
it seems to me , that beneath it all , we all want the same things .
love , companions ##hip , and a partner for our life ' s jo ##urn ##ies .
none of this makes total sense to me .

re : divorce is really stupid . . .
your post made me horribly sad .
my ex has that nice new life with the child - bride and the 2 cats and 2 dogs and new house and my son primarily lives with them even though he ends up being at my place 1 / 2 the time in a 2 - week period . - - i live in a 96 ##1 sq . ft . apartment .
my ex has most all of the photos as our son lives there and it ' s his history .
i did get a good bunch of the wedding photos , but my ex refused to give them all to me saying it was " his life too " even though i really res ##ent them being under the same roof with his child - bride .
i ' m sure they are taking lots of pictures of their trips / vacation ##s /
whatever ( at least 2 that i know of ) .
i do n ' t own a camera .
his new in ##law ##s are all former family friends i do n ' t have anything to do with anymore for obvious reasons .
his family ( brother , sister , stepmother ) convenient ##ly seem to forget that for almost 20 years i was a member of their family .
there was no gradual " drifting of out touch " despite the fact that we all live in the same city and my ex bi ##l and i even work within blocks of each other .
my family thinks my ex is pond sc ##um but because my parents are still members at the same church , they have to see my ex and his new wife every week .
my mother took his re ##mar ##ria ##ge harder than i did , i think , because of that .
divorce * is * really stupid .
du ##h - uh .
especially for those of us who still have so many years ( if one year for every 2 married , then i ' ve still got another 7 or so ) to go to get our heads screwed back on and find some sort of life that rivals what we had or what our ex has or what you and your ex have .
so far , this is not it . - - barbara s ##z .

dell is involved in a class action suit for " bait and switch " , where a nurse claims dell switched parts and charged her for the more expensive items , and for promising " easy credit " for which no one qu ##ali ##fies and then charges ridiculous ##ly high interest rates .

it seems someone did not read the credit terms , before purchasing item , " buyers ' remorse " .
and lawyers trying to make a buck from it .

re : dell sued for " bait and switch " and false promises
i agree that the buyer probably did n ' t read the credit terms to find themselves with an unexpected rate . . . i always see that " for qualified customers " in all of their advertisements that probably releases them of any wrong doing . . . but i also believe in the court systems so let it take its course and see what happens .
the only tor ##t reform that i think should be done is to cap fees that lawyers are allowed to extract for class action suits .
i feel that there is a valuable public service that comes from class actions suits which is to keep companies on the straight and narrow so that they avoid such actions . . . but from a monetary perspective the only real winners from class actions are the lawyers .
i remember once receiving a fifty cent check in an envelope with postage of at least half that amount for the great 17 " monitor class action suit .

re : dell sued for " bait and switch " and false promises
then there was the class action suit against gateway brought by some philadelphia lawyers a number of years ago .
gateway advertised and stick ##ered many of its 48 ##6 computers as " pen ##tium ready " , meaning that a special type 3 z ##if socket pen ##tium over ##drive could be installed and run .
micro ##nic ##s designed the mother ##boards used by gateway , and the basis of the design was a prototype pen ##tium over ##drive with an internal write - through cache , a more conservative cache design .
then intel changed the pen ##tium over ##drive , and the final version had a write - back cache .
when installed in a gateway system , the chip ran slower than slow , maybe about as fast as an ibm at , and bus - mastering devices like nic ##s and sc ##si cards refused to work .
so the lawyers sued gateway , and the settlement approved by the judge consisted of mega ##buck ##s for the lawyers and coup ##ons to owners of gateway 48 ##6 computers .
the coup ##on was good for $ 50 off on the purchase of a pen ##tium over ##drive processor from gateway , at its usual inflated prices ! ! !
so , let ' s see .
what does a discount coup ##on for a processor i ca n ' t use in my system do for me ?
i wonder how many people glee ##fully cash ##ed in their coup ##ons and bought pen ##tium over ##drive ##s from gateway .
intel eventually compensated by making available an " inter ##pose ##r " , a little socket ##ed thing ##ie installed between the pen ##tium over ##drive and the z ##if socket .
the sole purpose of the inter ##pose ##r was to raise a signal on the cpu to force its cache to operate in the write - thru mode which was compatible with most z ##if socket 3 48 ##6 mother ##boards .
needles ##s to say , this was the least successful " over ##drive " cpu ever done by intel .
the 48 ##6 - d ##x ##4 over ##drive was ok , as were several socket 5 pen ##tium over ##drive ##s and the socket 8 pen ##tium pro over ##drive .
finally intel gave up on over ##drive ##s . . . ben myers

re : dell sued for " bait and switch " and false promises
believe it or not there are companies that go over the line and need to be hit with a stick called a law suit .
it seems the fear of law suits is the only thing that keeps some of these crooked companies in line .
the government sure does n ' t have the resources or desire to pursue them so it ' s left to the private sector to protect themselves .
lawyers are bounty hunters of sorts .
bt ##w , i hate lawyers but there are times that they are useful .
some are sl ##ea ##ze ##bags but that can be said of most professions . there has to be at least a little threat of " let the company be ##ware " to maintain a balance otherwise it ' ll be open season on consumers .

re : dell sued for " bait and switch " and false promises
the only people who profit from class actions are the lawyers .
since companies are going to be sued in class action , regardless of the merits of the case , the threat of a class action is not a det ##rim ##ent .
if you do n ' t believe that , witness the vi ##ox ##x lawsuits .
the company making vi ##ox ##x determined it might increase mortality and pulled it from the market .
because of that , it is being sued .
the companies making similar drugs ( ce ##le ##bre ##x and be ##xt ##ra ) did not pull their product from the market .
they are not being sued .
doing the right thing provides no protection from class action .
all class actions do is en ##rich lawyers and raise costs to everyone .
the cost of class actions is factor ##ed into the cost of everything you buy .

ot best organization for donation
i would like to make a donation to help the survivors of the tsunami .
i have a lot of skepticism with the red cross and a few others based on horror stories i have heard reported in the media .
because of this i have always shi ##ed away from these national organizations and stuck with local groups .
any thoughts as to where my money would go the fur ##thest . appreciate any input .

i ' ve heard mostly positive things about how the red cross is handling their donations , with a very high percentage of the donated funds going directly for relief and not for administrative expenses .
so that is the channel we chose for our own donation .
for what it ' s worth to you , here ' s some contact information for a few agencies that seem to be highly regarded .
the habitat for humanity might be a good one to consider , since their expertise is in building housing , which of course is so bea ##dly needed over there at this time :

re : ot best organization for donation
actually more of the money from your donation has a chance of going directly toward its intended purpose than any other charity .
the red cross normally de ##du ##cts 9 % from all de ##duction ##s for its ad ##mini ##stra ##tic ##e costs .
it has announced that it will fore ##go the 9 % on donations ear ##mark ##ed for tsunami relief and that 100 % of these funds will go directly toward aid .
9 % in administrative costs would place the red cross among charity organizations making the the most efficient use of donated funds .
the figure for most charities is 10 - 16 % .
i do n ' t know what negative stories about the red cross you have heard . but nothing is 100 % and no organization of any kind is perfect .
just because of its size , which dwarfs most other charities , i would assume that the red cross may be responsible for proportion ##ately more blu ##nder ##s than most other charitable organizations . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
as tragic as the earthquake and tsunami in south asia have been , it is truly up ##lifting to see how so many people have opened their hearts and so generous ##ly responded to the call for help toward disaster relief efforts .
money from private donations has been flowing into charitable relief organizations at an unprecedented rate , in some cases by millions of dollars per hour .
" tsunami aid " was the fourth most frequently used term used in internet searches last week .
although the need for help is still continuing , some individual charities have announced that they have already received as much in donations as they can put to use for this effort .
the following announcement was received from ms ##f
" doctors without borders / med ##ecin ##s sans frontier ##es ( ms ##f ) has received an extraordinary out ##pour ##ing of support for the people of south asia and we are extremely grateful .
as you know , it is very important to ms ##f that we use your contribution as you intend it to be used .
this is why we want to let you know that at this time , ms ##f estimates that we have received sufficient funds for our currently fore ##see ##n emergency response in south asia . "

i ' ve read that too - unfortunate , because i ' ve worked with them in rwanda and was very impressed with the professional ##ism of their organization .
they also stated that there are lots of places in the world where they continue to work which needs plenty of help too - quite an important reminder because other needy areas of the world are getting less donations now .
so they did n ' t discourage donations to them per se , just not for this specific area .
of course i realize that most people will want to help where the need for it is the most immediate .
all in all , the statement has confirmed my view that doctors without borders ia a very professional opera ##to ##in .

re : pissed ?

in q he ' s in charge of the car from the moment he attempts to put the key in the door lock .
if he ' s asleep in the back seat with the keys in his possession then he ' s the person in charge of the car .
the offence is being drunk in charge of a vehicle - - as distinct from being drunk while operating a vehicle ( which is a separate offence ) .
the way to avoid being charged is to give the keys to someone else to unlock the door and have them hang on to the keys until you ' re below . 05 .
the standard ruse is to throw the keys under the car after you ' ve unlocked the door ( which you can later claim was unlocked by a person unknown ) .
in this case the offender escaped conviction first time around because it was accepted that he attempted to get rid of the keys , which supposedly landed in his lap .
judge mcgill got it right as the law stands . - - john h

just trying to understand here . . . given this quote : "

does that mean if i ' m at home alone getting pissed with the car keys on the coffee table and the car parked outside , that i ' m " in a position to drive the vehicle if i choose to do so without first taking charge of it from some other person " and can therefore be charged ?
sure , no reasonable cop would do that , but just strictly talking from the law side of things .
or does the fact that i ' m on private property change that ?
or what if i were in a bar with the car outside , keys in my pocket , but i ' ve decided i ' ll take the train home later ?
it would be a pretty sad state of the laws if they could come in , ask for the owner of car reg ##o " xx ##x - 999 " and breath ##alis ##e me because i had the keys in my pocket .

i ' m reminded of when i lived in another state and the local cop charged the town drunk in his driveway after following him home from the pub .
the drunk was acquitted on the technical ##ity that he was n ' t on a public road when the cop arrested him .
would n ' t have happened under q ##ld law - - and should n ' t have happened anywhere else .

need active angel investor for guaranteed capital deal
i am the head of a company that raised an angel round of financing from a san francisco angel investor who i never physically met initially .
without sounding pre ##ten ##tious , he read my business plan and on the strength of it , wired me money a few weeks later
i am currently reviewing investor interest for a guaranteed motion picture capital fund ( yes investment is 100 % protected and secured in the event films do not per ##fo ##m using innovative fia ##nc ##ing hedge ) for the following
i am looking for an active investor / partner for several films including a russian " good ##fell ##as " meets " once upon a time in america " and several high end stud ##i - esq ##ue horror films where the principal of an investment is secured 100 % exclusive of performance .
there is ripe window of opportunity right now for independently financed film exam ##pl ##ified with the recent success of such films as nap ##ole ##an dynamite ( made for 250 , 000 , sold for 5 mil , made 50 million at b . o . ) , garden state , open water , maria full of grace , motor ##cy ##le diaries , saw ( made for 750 , 000 - made 60 mil . ) and others .
the ceo ##s and ex ##ec ##s of companies such as fred smith of fed ##ex , norman wait ##t of gateway , jeff sk ##oll of e ##bay , roger marino of em ##c , marc turtle ##ta ##ub of the money store , marc cuban / todd wagner , and others have all parked their money in film ventures and deals similar to ours ,
i need a similar self made entrepreneur who recently sold his company ; is currently at the helm of one ; or , a recently exited executive with a large se ##verance pay who is sitting in the middle of nowhere , usa , is bored , and has always secretly wanted to get into the film business for tax , vanity , or alternative investment reasons .
while it seems there are other situations that are similar to mine , i feel that because i do offer a 100 % capital guarantee of principal on investment , my business model and risk mini ##mi ##zation offers more of a clear cut exit strategy than just a pie in the sky deal .
i am looking for someone who can help me get the financing and is no fr ##ill ##s , reliable , and visionary when it will come down to it .
someone who has an extensive network in alternative investments , hedge funds , private equity , and an old - school network .
i am not looking for a boiler room cold caller , but someone that can present my deal to 5 - 10 guys and make it happen .

the pain of childbirth
i have 2 girls already , nearly 8 and 4 . 5 y ##rs and i have always said i will never forget the pain of childbirth .
abby was a true water birth ( 3 kg - normal ) and with fiona i was dragged out of the pool after the head crowned ( g ##yn ##o had written on my notes she was 4 kg ( large ) and that she was not to be born in the water ( long painful story ! ) i can still remember though the pain i felt .
i am on the large side but i am so worried about how i ' m going to cope with a natural childbirth without a pool ( not available round here ) .
i ' ve seen videos and heard of ladies who have " managed " their pain control .
how in heavens name can you do that ?
i ' ve been there ; i know what the pain feels like ! !
can anyone give me advice or let me know of any techniques which might be able to help ?
thanks in advance .

if you go for a home birth you can rent a birth ##ing pool . i would n ' t nec ##ess ##ari ##tly say that you will have a repeat labour ! my first labour i was 30 hours and had an ep ##id ##ural after 22 hours . # 2 i went in saying " give me the ep ##id ##ural asa ##p - and never got to the state where i felt that i needed it .
only had tens and gas - and - air .
so do n ' t give up on the idea of a natural birth because last time was painful . i think different people / different labour ##s are different , so just because one person says " i did *
*
* and it did n ' t hurt a bit " does n ' t mean that it will work for someone else , so going in with a set of suggestions , and being prepared to try them and see which is the best is probably the most helpful .

my girlfriend was on the run from probation in fl ##a when she got herself in trouble here in az .
which app ##aran ##tly , true to her habits , she tried to avoid by not showing up for court .
time goes by , we meet etc etc she gets herself under the scrutiny of the police and into jail again .
fl ##a trouble 1999 she signed a wai ##ver of extra ##dition as part of her plea deal
az in trouble in 2001 , fl ##a is mentioned and she signs another wai ##ver of extra ##dition , posts bonds and skip ##s ( not far enough app ##aran ##tly )
az troubles again in 2004 , she serves 6 months , then the day before she is to be released to do 5 y ##rs probation her in az , fl ##a shows up and takes her to fl ##a face ##ing her original 1999 charges which are still open ( she failed mis ##era ##bly at probation ) i think they want to give her 3 years .
my question isa this , what the heck is a wai ##ver of extra ##dition good 4 ?
how will her probation be affected here ?
i ask around locally and no one will reply , not her public defender , the public defenders office , so i guess this is my last resource cu ##ase i can not afford to consult with an attorney . thanks in advance , ml ##m the guy who should ##a known better . . . . . . . . . . . . .

the wai ##ver of extra ##dition that she signed simply means that if she skip ##s out and goes to another state , she ca n ' t contest the right of the original court to have her hauled back to its jurisdiction , and that the court wo n ' t have to initiate the time - consuming process of extra ##dit ##ing her .
instead , if the cops pick her up , she can be shipped back without delay .

re : wai ##ver of extra ##dition means what
she ' s going to have a lot of separate offenses to account for by this time .
2 " ft ##a " s ( failure to appear ) , one in fl and one in az , plus whatever the original charges were in both cases .
that means she has given up the right to force the fl authorities to go thru legal due process in demanding that the az authorities turn her over to them for further prosecution .
all the fl prosecutors have to do is ask , and the az jail ##ers will pack her up in a van or a plane and ship her back to fl for trial on the ft ##a charge and probably to commence her serving time under the suspended sentence that went along with her original probation .
she ' s in deep sh _ _ t if you have n ' t already figure that out .
nowhere in usa would be far enough if she waived extra ##dition .
of course they do .
that ' s what her wai ##ver of extra ##dition meant they could do .
they let her serve her time in az , then they come and get her to serve her time in fl .
this is what happens when people blow off the chances they are given to straighten out by being given probation .
thumb your nose at the court often enough , and they will bring all sorts of crap down on your head , re - institut ##ing the original suspended sentences and possibly adding on for the ft ##a .
what is it good for ?
it ' s good for the state , not for the convict . it lets them skip some of the legal procedures she would otherwise be entitled to , in order to ship her from one state to another .
but they were entitled to demand that wai ##ver as a condition of probation ; if she had not agreed to voluntarily wai ##ve that right , they probably would have just thrown her in jail for the 3 year sentence the first time around and she would n ' t have been given the chance to go straight during probation and avoid jail altogether .
she does n ' t have a lot of lee ##way here .
she has done this numerous times and they are not likely to give her another wide open chance like they did the first 3 times .
she will probably have to serve out her sentence in fl , and if she has not already served all her time in az , they will then ship her back there to do that time .
wait ##ami ##ni ##t , you said she does have a public defender ?
ok , he / she is doing all they can , but that ' s not much , under the circumstances . you ' re complaining that you ca n ' t get an at ##ty ?
you do n ' t need one . and her at ##ty ##s will not talk to you because you are not entitled to participate in their confidential communications with their client . but wo n ' t your g ##f tell you these things ?
if not , maybe it ' s because she does n ' t want you to know either .
which you would then take into account in deciding if you still want her to be your significant other .

question regarding simple assault & amp ; battery
my roommate was hospitalized in mid - november for lung surgery and spent several days on loads of pain medication .
on the fourth day of his stay , he was moved out of the ic ##u to the step - down unit , with a diagnosis of " ic ##u psycho ##sis secondary to na ##rco ##tic administration " and post thor ##aco ##sto ##my . " he was confused , because of the medication but was not aggressive or threatening in any manner . i saw him each day and as soon as we spoke , he became oriented and was perfectly fine .
this was witnessed by both the nursing staff and his doctors .
during the early evening hours of his sixth hospital day , he got up , dressed , pulled his chest tube out and managed to get out of the hospital and across four lanes of busy evening traffic , to our apartment .
by the time he got to our home , he was very short of breath and there was a nurse and orderly who told me " he ' s crazy and just walked out .
" i sat him down on the couch and talked to him , and asked him what had happened .
he said he ' d asked for something for pain and they told him ##e he could n ' t have anything .
then the orderly was apparently rude to him , and that ' s when he got up and decided to come home .
a short time later , two police officers showed up and told me they had to take him back to the hospital .
he went back with the officers , gave them no problems at all .
i received a call from the shift supervisor who told me they ' d replaced his chest tube , given him some pain medication and he was doing much better .
i told her to pass on the other shifts that if he became confused or upset to call me , and i ' d talk to him , and get him settled down .
at 2 : 15 the next morning , i received a call from the night shift supervisor who told me my friend had been " verbal ##ly abusive and aggressive " and would i come over and talk to him .
so , i went over there , getting to his room right at 2 : 30 .
there were two cops there and i asked what had happened .
my roommate was in bed , sound asleep , and had all of his clothes on .
a nurse said , " he beat two of us up . the cops are here because we ' re pressing charges .
" i ' ve lived with this man 9 years and never in that time have i ever seen him be aggressive , violent or abusive in anyway .
i asked to speak to the two nurses whom he ' d all ##edge ##dly hit and was told i could n ' t do that .
an hour or so passed and the got my roommate out of bed , took his chest tube out and discharged him .
he was sent to another hospital with a ps ##ych unit until his psycho ##sis resolved .
i was given copies of a citation for simple assault and battery , then went to the police station several days later to find out what other paperwork was available on this incident .
i was given a copy of a different citation , but with the identical information from the one i ' d gotten the night of the incident . the police report has the victim saying she was " choked to where she almost lost consciousness , struck in the face with a belt buckle and it had left large marks , and that he ' d grabbed her breasts and left marks .
according to the police report , this woman never reported to the er for verification of the injuries and no one else can verify exactly what happened to provoke this incident .
my roommate has no rec ##oll ##ection of the time from the day before the incident happened until he woke up at the other hospital .
he was cited for simple assault and battery .
if there is no evidence , and that includes the belt buckle , how can the county prose ##cute this case . ?
all of his belongings were returned to me upon his discharge , with the exception of the belt buckle .
the police do not have it and the hospital does n ' t know what happened to it .
also , i was looking at both citations , i did n ' t get to the hospital until 2 : 30 am , and the officer has the time of incident as being at 2 : 34 am .
does anyone besides me see a problem with any of this ?
what kind of rec ##ours ##e does my roommate have in all of this ?
thanks from oklahoma

re : question regarding simple assault & amp ; battery
you need an attorney right away .
you are not going to be able to poke holes in this case with internet advice .
in addition , i ' s suggest raising the stakes .
the hospital obviously knew that your friend was having head problems , and they improper ##ly treated him by not sending him to a ps ##ych ward , which allowed the situation to get worse until the point where he assaulted someone .
sue them for mal ##pr ##actic ##e , and make the number big enough to get some serious attention .

get a criminal defense lawyer ( i do n ' t say that very often on this news ##group ) .
if your roommate can not afford one , contact your roommate ' s parents about paying for one , or ask about getting a court appointed lawyer .
tell the lawyer that you will help with the case ( do administrative stuff , etc ) in any way that would help him / her defend your roommate .

north korea has nuclear weapons .
the foreign minister of north korea has state that north korea has nuclear weapons and has officially with drawn from the 6 nation talks on nuclear proliferation in east asia .
the foreign minister also indicated that north korea will continue to develop long range missiles capable of ob ##lite ##rating any target within the borders of the united states .
according to east asia intelligence sources , north korea has already prep ##osition ##ed nuclear tipped missiles on freighter ##s and fishing tr ##aw ##lers that are sailing under foreign flags of convenience , that are stationed off the west coast and east coast of the united states .
missiles launched from these vessels are said to be able to hit 90 % percent of the major cities with in 2 and one half minutes from time of launch .
i do n ' t know about the rest of you but i think that in the next few weeks i will be moving supplies and equipment to my site in eastern oregon .
of course you can do what you want but i do n ' t trust the pot bell ##ied idiot kim junk ill any farther than i could throw him . - -

re : north korea has nuclear weapons .
well here is the problem that i face and many should be worried about . if north korea has had nuclear weapons for a few years then they developed them during the clinton administration .
the clinton administration also allowed lo ##ral to sell missile technology to china , who have been helping pakistan to build their missiles .
that technology has undo ##ub ##ta ##bly made it back to north korea ( pakistan , iran and north korea are all working on the same set of missile blue prints ) .
so now we have north korea with nuclear weapons and work ##able missiles .
also since we missed the boat on north korea and nuclear weapons how can we be sure that iran does n ' t have nuclear weapons ?
the simple and wise ##st action is to assume that they do have a small number and are working fever ##ishly to build a bigger arsenal .
now the nut of the question should be , what if iran gives , sells , provides nuclear weapons to islamic ex ##tre ##mist ##s to smug ##gle into the united states and at 10 am on a wednesday pop 2 or 3 in new york city , destroying wall street , the large banks , the large insurance companies , the large sock broker ##age houses and many other world wide financial institutions .
at the same time 2 weapons go off in washington dc and take out the president , the vice president , 80 senators , and 350 congress ##men as well as the department of the treasury , interior , health and welfare , justice , commerce and the federal court system .
and then just for yu ##cks lets assume that one goes off at the pentagon .
now what do we do ?
remember all your pension funds are now gone . all your investments are gone . all the bank records are gone . no more government payments for federal employees . no more government payments for aid to schools , environment , police , courts , well fare , etc . the dollar is now worthless on the international market . with a worthless dollar the amount of fuel available is not cut by 80 % . no more cheap imports of clothes , boots , appliances , computer stuff , communications equipment , generators , electric motors cars , trucks etc . massive unemployment as we are now in a service economy with nothing to service .
does the word te ##ot ##wa ##wk ##i have any meaning .
oh i expect to things to hang together for a few weeks as local , county , and state governments try to hold things together , but they wo n ' t .
with out fuel to move food stuff ##s from the farms to food manufactures to local warehouses food stuff ##s will dry up with in a few week or so .
with out fuel to move imported stuff ( most of what we buy these days ) from the ports of entry to local warehouses and local retailer shelves of items like building materials , tools , and every thing else we buy the shelves will be empty in a month or so .
of course the above does not take into account that people driven by fear do n ' t riot and lo ##ot every thing in site in the first week .
if the attack should happen in the winter , no natural gas from canada to heat homes , or fire steam driven electrical generators .
of course we could convert back to coal but it will take a couple of weeks to convert them to coal but then how do you get the coal from the mines to the power plants ? ? ?
with no social security or pension payments , aid to dependent children and other government payments , food stamps , ( which are all checks and vo ##ucher ##s ) , and there are no banks to cash them , ( they got all wiped out in the new york financial destruction remember ) no body will accept them .
no the situation does n ' t look good from where i sit .
oh we can work on the assumption that the mu ##llah ##s of iran will be rational , ( but how rational are people who train and fund suicide bombers ) and a rational kim junk ill ( who lets large numbers of his people star ##ve to death every year so he can have nuclear weapons ) kidnap ##s japanese citizens to teach english , kidnap ##s movie stars so he can have private performances etc .
look at kim jung ill behavior over the last decade or so any you will find that hitler was a saint compared to kim junk ill .
no it ' s going to be a scary time for the next decade or so and the neo - chamber ##lins ( most of the leftist that most on this board ) ( you know prime minister chamber ##lin holding up his piece of paper containing an agreement from herr hitler with peace in our time ) , are not going to do one thing to keep this country safe .
by the way i consider , kerry , dean , kennedy , carl levin , la ##the ##y , mu ##rry , finest ##ien , boxer , ( oh hell the whole democratic party ) and members of the press as neo - chamber ##lins .
well on to a happier note .
i have a job interview today for a permanent position that will pay 20 % more than my contracting does and will have benefits .
contracting here in oregon is going at $ 14 . 00 an hour at intel ##l , up to $ 20 an hour at other places .
why should hi tech firms pay more in the united states than they do in china or india ?
just heard yesterday that he ##wl ##ett packard is shutting down its plant in eugene , ( thank you very much ms . fi ##orin ##a ) and sun micro systems is all but gone from oregon .

re : s corp profit distribution and bank ##rup ##cy .
was the trustee informed of the transfer of the shares ?
since you gave your uncle the shares prior to his discharge , the shares should have become assets available to the bankruptcy estate for the satisfaction of debts .
if the share transfer was reported to the trustee and the trustee did nothing about them , then you may be ok ; however , if you failed to inform the trustee , then your uncle may be liable for hiding assets , which would , at the minimum , invalid ##ate his discharge .
even if the transfer does n ' t invalid ##ate the whole discharge , the distribution might be subject to for ##feit ##ure to pay creditors ' claims if you failed to inform the trustee of the share transfer .
you need to speak to a bankruptcy attorney pro ##nto ; this is a bankruptcy matter , not a tax matter .

re : s corp profit distribution and bank ##rup ##cy .
yes , but according to the facts you first gave , he had not yet received the bankruptcy discharge when you gave him the shares .
i believe you had said that you gave him the shares in february 2004 but that the discharge did n ' t come until june of 2004 .
that means that he received the shares while he was still in bankruptcy , which means that the shares were potentially assets that the trustee could use to pay off creditors .
a bankruptcy case does n ' t close until you get the discharge order , and until then everything that the debt ##or receives is fair game for the trustee .
if the trustee was informed of the shares and did nothing about it , you are more likely than not ok , but if the trustee was n ' t informed of the fact directly , then you may be in trouble .
if , however , your uncle received the shares after he obtained an order of discharge from the bankruptcy court , then as a general matter the creditors can not go after the shares , unless they can prove that there was col ##lusion between you and your uncle to hide his assets from them ( e . g . , by putting his assets in the corporation ' s name and then waiting until after the bankruptcy to transfer the shares to him ) .

a serial killer in wichita , kansas who killed at least 8 people in the ' 70s and ' 80s .
bt ##k stands for bind , torture , and kill .
he sent several letters to the police and the media during that time .
and now he is communicating with them again , sending token ##s from his victims .

re : bt ##k why is it so difficult to get him ?
you do well to wonder why the bt ##k killer was not captured until yesterday .
the informal speculation is that the wichita police department was not up to the task .
consider this :
- one of the bt ##k killer ' s victims lived on the same street as the killer
- the bt ##k killer once called up a police dispatch ##er and told her of the crime he just committed , and still they could not catch him
- the bt ##k killer was a known ni ##tp ##ick ##er and nu ##issa ##nce .
this is actually a indicator in profiles of serial killers and master ##mind terrorists .
- the bt ##k killer was only found out when his daughter recognized certain traits and turned in her dna , which was a close match to the dna on file for her father .
like in the case of the un ##ib ##om ##ber , if it was n ' t for the fore ##sight and charity of a relative , the bt ##k killer would still be loose .
i was once reading how a criminal was being tracked in washington , dc , and how he escaped a police drag ##net several times , once by taking a taxi .
though there are very brave police , to a large extent the police have no incentive to capture a criminal , just to stay out of harm ' s way and to collect facts after the fact .
the rich hire private security for a reason - - public security is often inadequate .

[ tan ] parole
this is just a point of interest , i am not going to jail , and most certainly not in america - and my interest lies in the american jail system .
i ' ve brows ##ed around the internet and ca n ' t find the information i ' m after .
what ' s the deal with parole ?
if you get out on parole , what happens then , and how long does it last ? ( and , specifically , who takes you home once you get out of jail , or do you just get turf ##ed out and expected to check in with your parole officer the next day ? ) .
and , again fairly specifically ( and i realise this is state specific , but i ' m kinda looking for a general answer here ) : if an eighteen year old gets caught selling marijuana to 12 - 14 year olds , and gets put away for , say , three years , is this the sort of deal where he ' s likely to get parole , or just do the time and leave again ?

re : [ tan ] parole
getting out on parole is usually a reward for good behavior while serving time .
so you ' re basically free , with the expectation that you will not leave the state ( assuming you ' ve been jailed by the state gov ' t ) and you have to check in with your parole officer on a regular basis ( i think they give you a schedule ) .
i * believe * you are also expected to get a job , housing , etc . and report this also .
in some cases you may be referred to a specific ' halfway ' house for rein ##tro ##duction into society , and provided with a simple job .
as for how long it lasts , i would say that it lasts for the rest of your sentence , but i ' m not sure about that .
also , you can call someone to come pick you up when you leave , or call a taxi i guess .
not just state - specific , judge ( jury ) - specific and case - specific .
for some reason , i ca n ' t recall if selling drugs to minors qu ##ali ##fies as a jury trial or what .
but these decisions are entirely up to the judge / jury , and the decision is usually made in regard to the character of the defendant .

re : [ tan ] parole
this is all based on my experience in new york .
you have to provide a planned residence when you ' re considered for parole , usually a relative or program of some kind .
it lasts as long as the rest of your sentence lasts .
you can go back to prison for violating the conditions of your parole , for a period of time up until your sentence runs out .

indeed , new york ' s statute says , " discretion ##ary release on parole shall not be granted merely as a reward for good conduct or efficient performance of duties while confined but after considering if there is a reasonable probability that , if such inmate is released , he will live and remain at liberty without violating the law , and that his release is not incompatible with the welfare of society and will not so de ##pre ##cate the seriousness of his crime as to undermine respect for law .

ot : republican election standards
here on the left edge of the country , we have a unique perspective on election standards .
in iraq , an election takes place in which one of the three major forces v ##ying for control of the country opt ##s out .
a few people will turn out and elect somebody .
it is hailed as the greatest triumph of democracy since the defeat of imperial japan .
in washington state , our governor ' s race may be und ##ec ##ided for months to come .
following the election and rec ##ount process exactly as outlined in our state constitution , the democratic candidate won by a margin of less than 200 votes .
with roughly three million votes cast in the race , the margin of victory was a few ten thousands of one percent or some such microscopic amount .
for all intent ##s and purposes it was a tie - but somebody had to end up with a few more votes and this time around it was the demos .
the same group of people who have said " even if some regions are too unsafe for people to go to the polls and even if large portions of the population will not recognize the legitimacy of the outcome , some election is better than no election , and it ' s a great day for democracy ! " . . . . . . . . . . . are sui ##ng to overthrow the results of the governor ' s election is washington state because there were some " errors " in the process .
( they ho ##ller ##ed " fraud " until they got to court , but unable to find any evidence with which to sub ##stan ##tia ##te that charge they have backed down to " errors " . )
so the standards are : any old process halfway resembling an election is just did ##dly dan ##dy in iraq , but we wo n ' t accept the results of a free and fair election in washington state because there may have been a human error rate of 0 . 000 ##00 ##01 percent . in washington state , the election has to be not only free and fair , but also " perfect " .
( of course , the republicans would have thought the wa state election * was * perfect , had their candidate held the same 100 and some vote margin when all the smoke finally cleared ) . funny how the standards change , and so easily , depending on agenda .

re : republican election standards
we have seen our state ' s standards .
keep rec ##ount ##ing the votes until you get the results you want and if you need to go " find " some more votes in a warehouse , in a box , hidden behind some other boxes .
this is too funny .
the ones that are " opt ##ing " out are in one of three protected classes within iraq .
the protected classes are ku ##rd ' s , sunni ' s and women .
only vote that ends in a tie is where both sides have the exact same number of votes .
this did n ' t happen in washington state .

i ' m a democrat , a liberal and probably whole bunch of other labels that you can pin on me .
i ' m always glad to see people gain the opportunity to change their government from a dictatorship to a democracy .
everyone , everywhere should have the basic right to elect their government .
the problem with this election is that no matter what happens the results are going to be tainted and questionable .
think about this objective ##ly ( forget the us is involved ) , if a foreign country invaded another and set up elections , would n ' t a reasonable person question the validity of the election results ?
let ' s assign some names .
say it ' s 1942 , and the german o ##cc ##up ##iers in holland have set up elections with dutch candidates .
well , not really candidates , but political parties - - you ' ll be told who the candidates were later .
would you say the results are valid ?
even if you , john h , believe the us held imp ##art ##ial elections in iraq , do n ' t you think the rest of the world will find the results invalid , or least suspect ?

our soldiers weren ' e even close to the polls .
hell , they could n ' t even see the polls in most places , so the intimidation bullshit is just that .
even brian williams , when questioned by chris , had to admit that he saw nothing to show us intimidation .

you have to start somewhere and this election is to get a legislative body to write a constitution for iraq .
the next election will be the one with more legitimacy .

sorry about my hard ass attitude !
the us soldiers were purposely kept well away from the polls during the time the polls were open .
they were the outer of three con ##centric security rings , with the iraqi police and army occupying the closest two rings .
i watched a lot ( but not all , of course ) of the news on most of the different channels , staying up until 5 am ( like a real dummy ! ) .
i did n ' t see one instance of us soldiers at polling places .
i * did * see a lot of iraqi soldiers .
except for the us flag on the shoulder and the different weapons , they look pretty much the same .
hell , i noticed that some of the us soldiers were carrying ak ' s in one place !

us election fraud : whisper growing to a roar
now a person stating he is republican insider is blowing the whistle , indicating that the fraud was much greater than just a handful of votes in ohio and florida .
the ukraine has nothing on it .
according to this person kerry won decisive ##ly not only in ohio and florida but also in a number of other states and in the overall popular vote .
he says he knows how the fraud was worked .
could this be why so many in the bush gang have been jumping ship ?
how will it affect the two s ##ni ##vel ##lers john howard and tony blair if the whistle ##bl ##owing becomes as insistent as it did over the far , far lesser offences of richard nixon or the personal ind ##is ##cre ##tions of bill clinton ?

thanks to tony trough ##ton - smith for posting this article on the stop ##ma ##i wa news ##group .
see for a statement by michel chu ##ss ##ud ##ovsky about the host site .
dion giles western australia
voter fraud in florida and ohio :
kerry won the election by at least 1 , 7 million votes
by brad men ##fi ##l
the ur ##l of this article is : - - - - - - - - - - brad men ##fi ##l is not my real name .
i work for the rn ##c [ republican national committee ] .
i fear rep ##ris ##als if i ' m found out .
the truth about this election is this : florida and ohio had to go for bush in order for him to " win " the election .
in reality he lost both states .
in fact , he did not even win the popular vote .
he lost the national popular vote by at least 1 , 750 , 000 . this shows you the scale of the fraud .
the exit polls were not wrong .
kerry was the clear winner , but victory was snatched from him .
florida first .
the 200 , 000 + margin of victory for bush made this state un ##con ##test ##able .
everybody assumes that even with some fraud , kerry could never have made up the difference in a rec ##ount .
but kerry actually won by about 750 , 000 votes .
the numbers were changed by a computer program ( in both electronic and scan - tr ##on voting systems ) called " kerry ##lite . " " kerry ##lite " of course is not actual name of the program .
the actual name is 11 - 5 - 18 - 18 etc .
for additional encryption , the numbers were ju ##mbled but i ' m not sure in which order .
the numbers replace the letters of the alphabet .
for example , k is the eleventh letter of the alphabet .
so the if - then statement goes something like this : " if total true kerry ) total true bush , bush x 1 . 04 ##x ( . 04 is a random number ) ( total true kerry ) , total true bush " .
the second part of the equation takes the total number of votes cast and sub ##tra ##cts the new bush total , sub ##tra ##cts the third party totals and leaves the rest for kerry .
sometimes the program would also reduce third party votes and award them to bush .
and even where bush legitimate ##ly won , he was still awarded additional votes .
the big democratic counties ( brow ##ard for example ) went to kerry because it had to appear that everything was on the up and up .
it ' s interesting to see this un ##fold .
does anybody wonder why the republican counties were mostly counted after the democratic counties ? you should wonder , and also know that this was no accident . the bush team had to make up the votes as the night went on .
in ohio , computer voting fraud , vote tossing and voter suppression were the main methods .
vote tossing was simply the removal of kerry votes and some third party votes .
in some areas , the bush vs . kerry votes were absurd .
nine to one , eight to two .
voter suppression took the form of making voters stand in four hour long lines .
this of course took place in democratic areas .
the simplest thing to do was to have too few voting machines .
sometimes that ' s all it takes .
people eventually lose patience and leave without casting a vote .
in other states such as new mexico , nevada , iowa and new hampshire , kerry ' s leads eva ##por ##ated very quickly once the polls were shut down .
kerry only won new hampshire , but barely .
as it turned out , the lead was 6 % for kerry in that state and not enough fraudulent activity took place to flip the state to bush .
so this will all come out and be known to everyone .
nothing this massive can be kept a secret .
you ' re already beginning to see these " irregularities " and the whisper will become a roar .

bush has no shame ( np ##c )
i really could n ' t believe what i was watching while bush put medals on talent , franks and br ##eme ##r .
talent was in charge of the cia when two of the most costly intelligence failures in american history happened - - not recognizing the sept . 11 plot , and wrongly claiming that saddam had a stock ##pile of w ##md ##s .
even people who mind ##lessly defend bush ' s policies , like w ##j ##b ##6 ##7 , do n ' t want to take responsibility for talent - - they point out that he was originally appointed by clinton .
franks was in charge of the operation that was supposed to quickly go in , take over iraq , and then start moving our troops out rapidly - - at this point i think we ' re going to see our troops over there at least through the end of the decade .
and br ##eme ##r decided to destroy the existing iraqi army , leaving it up to us and new recruits to try to impose order .
this is just one more of those wi ##er ##d , through - the - looking - glass moments when bush is trying to make something that at the very least has to be seen as tr ##ou ##bling , and that i consider an un ##mit ##igate ##d failure , into a success .

he was not given very much to work with - - cheney and rum ##my are the ones to blame for the screwed up war plans - of course i am sure they will get their medals too .
bush is one of those guys that just sees how he wants to see , and that is a terrible trait for a leader to have - - - rose - colored something something i bel ##ei ##ve it ' s called .
now this is an argument against bush i can throw my arms around !

ok , so if iran is saying that they are moving forward with their nuclear programs for science and friendly nuclear energy , why is the us so worried ?
they are just trying to produce energy , as we have several nuclear power plants .
and all the demands to syria . . . this all seems so predictable .
and if you were wondering , this is the link i got that from . . .

please .
this is a cop - out response .
the reason we are so worried is because we are on a higher level than 90 % of the world because we have nu ##cle ##r weapons .
if countries we do n ' t like start developing nuclear weapons - grade material it makes us nervous .
although so far , iran has shown that they are * not * producing weapons - grade material and are in fact using their nuclear power for just that , according to the ia ##ea .
but when you have a sitting president who has an in ##fat ##uation with pro ##voking other countries into a war , you can bet that he will try everything he can to try to prove his case against iran .
maybe because oil is a much bigger poll ##uting source of energy than nuclear ?
or maybe because it ' s more cost effective for them to use nuclear than any other method ?
why should they run their energy supply off of one of their backbone industries when oil is worth more to them on the open market ? - - " i am not allowed to ever come up with a single original thought . and i am not allowed to meet the criminal government agent who op ##press ##es me .

it ' s not a question of whether i believe iran is telling the truth .
the question was asked : why is the us scared of iran , and your response was " because they ' re lying " .
this is a cop - out because you ' re not really proving anything , you ' re just making accusations without proof .
ok , they made a very very small amount of a material that could maybe be used in a weapon if they had more of it possibly .
but the fact is that iran is cooper ##ating with most of the international community on this issue , whether your believe them or not .
this was about nuclear proliferation , not iraq ' s insurgency .
i think that if they have proof of iran ' s assistance to iraqi insurgents that it can be dealt with later , once iraq is secure and able to handle its own affairs . for now , we were talking about the iranian nuclear program , not iraq .

not if you have a melt ##down or need to get rid of spent fuel rods .
also , i would doubt one of the biggest export ##ers of oil is that concerned with being environmentally
syria has occupied lebanon , they are in violation of security council resolution 155 ##9 stating that there should be no foreign forces in lebanon and that le ##ba ##bon should be allowed to have free elections .
our alliance to them is supporting people that want to have a free democratic ##ally elected gov ' t .
finish the statement : then we will refer them to the security council .
what exactly is wrong with that ?
that is the type of diplomatic solution that all of the anti - war people wanted for iraq .
of course a whole bunch of resolutions did nothing in iraq , but who knows , maybe this time they will work .
personally , based on the aggressive stance they have taken and the way they are helping the insurgency in iraq , i tend to not believe them when they say that they are n ' t looking for a confrontation .

there is one carousel organization again

there is one carousel organization again
i just received the latest issue of merry - go - round ##up , the quarterly publication of the national carousel association .
in it was a blur ##b reporting that the american carousel society had recently disbanded .
some of you may be wondering why there were two carousel organizations in the first place .
the national carousel association was founded in the early 1970 ' s by a group of art historians and collectors , including frederick fried , author of the 1964 book " a pictorial history of the carousel " that single - handed ##ly gave the classic hand - carved wooden carousel the respect and appreciation it deserved .
other founders included charlotte ding ##er , who was already a major collector of carousel artwork at the time .
the purpose of the nc ##a is " to promote conservation , appreciation , knowledge and enjoyment of the art of the classic wooden carousel and especially the preservation of complete wooden carousel ##s . "
the organization attracted a wide range of members , including carousel enthusiasts , owners / operators , theme and amusement parks , museums , libraries , those in the entertainment / recreation industry , art collectors and even auction houses , among others .
it was the presence of these last two named groups that would eventually stir up controversy .
thanks in large part to the nc ##a , the art of the carousel was receiving a lot of public attention and appreciation that it had not enjoyed before .
however , this new and brighter spotlight on these antique rides also had the unfortunate effect of enhancing the collect ##ibility and monetary value of operational carousel ##s .
they had become worth more money dead ( i . e . in pieces ) than alive ( i . e . functioning ) .
as such , during the 1980 ' s many beautiful and unique wooden carousel ##s would be broken up at the auction block , as owners rushed to cash in on the antique marketplace .
the liability insurance crisis further aggravated the situation , as amusement park operators sought to cut their losses , while at the same time liquid ##ate under ##per ##form ##ing carousel ##s to raise capital for the purchase of newer and more profitable ( thrill ) rides .
some collectors of carousel art and auction houses were accused of using their nc ##a affiliation to gain information about vintage carousel ##s that they could target for breakup to their own personal profit , a practice certainly contrary to the stated goals of the organization . the increasing rift between the " preservation ##ists " and " collectors " would eventually boil over into an internal political struggle that caused many in the collectors faction of the nc ##a to walk out of the group , including founders such as charlotte ding ##er and others .
the preservation ##ists would chose to remain with the nc ##a , including fred fried .
at this time in the late 1970 ' s , carousel artwork collector and printer marge sw ##ens ##on was the editor of the nc ##a ' s merry - go - round ##up publication . the political struggle that occurred within the nc ##a resulted in two slate ##s of officers being presented for approval to the membership , something that was not supposed to happen .
a thicker - than - usual issue of the round ##up would be filled with accusations from both factions in the group each accusing the other of improper behavior .
sw ##ens ##on herself would also leave the nc ##a .
not much later , she began publishing her own magazine called " carousel art " , which was essentially a scholarly photo album depicting different carver ##s and styles each month .
meanwhile , those collectors who left the national carousel association banded together to form the american carousel society ( ac ##s ) , whose stated aims of carousel preservation also recognized collectors as a positive asset towards that goal .
for the next couple of decades , the two carousel organizations would co - exist , each attracting its share of members .
some would actually join both groups , and even attend both of their annual conventions .
during the mid - 1980 ' s walter lou ##ck would begin publishing " the carousel trader " , later renamed " the carousel news & amp ; trader " .
this monthly magazine would cover all angles and sides of the story of the carousel and be well received by all carousel enthusiasts .
about a decade later , carousel art would suddenly cease publication .
the nc ##a would continue to issue the round ##up to its members .
the mid to late 1990 ' s saw the passing of nc ##a founder fred fried , and also that of charlotte ding ##er , both who represented the two opposite points of view in the carousel preservation debate .
coincidentally and amazingly , the art of building hand - carved carousel ##s ( and even band ##org ##ans ) has been revived , with firms such as carousel works and carousel magic again building the popular rides in classic design .
this development seems to have greatly alleviate ##d the antique marketplace pressures that have doomed so many legacy wooden carousel ##s over the past several decades .
the turn of the new mill ##eni ##um actually witnesses ##ed a tha ##w in the relationship between the national carousel association and american carousel society , as newer and younger leadership took over from the founding generation .
the two groups decided that the bi ##cker ##ing between them was waste ##ful , con ##ter ##pro ##ductive and pointless .
there was talk of a ( re ) merger but the regulations governing non - profits prevented that . however , it was decided that nc ##a and ac ##s hold joint conventions to save on costs to both the clubs and the members .
just within the past couple of months though , the american carousel society had determined that they did not have the funding to continue with the operation of their organization and officially ceased to exist .
so now , once again there is a single nationwide organization to join if you love carousel ##s !

club sports policies at schools ; specifically travel restrictions
hello everyone -
i am attempting to learn more information about the policies of various athletic departments at schools , specifically with regards to ultimate teams .
at northwestern , the men ' s ultimate team falls under the club sports department which falls into a dark , barely lit corner of the athletic department .
there are some restrictions on what we can and can not do .
the one that i am most interested in comparing to similar policies at other schools concerns our ability to travel .
at northwestern , we are allowed to either rent school vans for no charge or take our own vehicles to tournaments within 300 miles of evans ##ton , il .
also , we are allowed to fly , take a bus , or take amtrak to any tournament we want , no matter how far away it is .
we are allowed to compete under the northwestern name if we take any of these options .
however , it often occurs that we want to go to a tournament farther than 300 miles without flying .
( for example , regional ##s is often slightly farther than 300 miles , yet a reasonable drive . ) if we choose to do so , it is understood that we are not officially competing under the northwestern name - we are just a group of people playing ultimate at a tournament and not involving the university in any way .
do any of you other college players face similar restrictions in your travel ?
what are your schools ' policies ?
i am interested in both the responses of players at public and private schools .
feel free to email me if you do want to post to the forum .
thanks for your help .

re : club sports policies at schools ; specifically travel restrictions
man . . . you guys have it so sweet .
pitt gets $ 2000 / year towards competition .
that means bids , hotel , transportation , jerseys ( i do have to mention , our jerseys this year are hot ) .
that does nt go very far , and that s a hard cap on anything related to competition for all compete ##tive club sports teams .
next year we will be budget ##ing our jerseys as " practice jerseys " however , so we hope they ' ll be paid for . the point is , $ 2 ##k gets us to about a tournament and a half using university transportation .
i do nt know about playing officially under the university ' s name , or why that matters really .
as long as the registrar signs off on the roster for the up ##a , does nt the importance of university affiliation become mo ##ot ?

i should clarify that nu does not specifically pay for us to fly - we get a budget as well .
we pay for our flights / rental cars out of pocket .

it matters for liability questions .

re : club sports policies at schools ; specifically travel restrictions
at sun ##y albany in ny , about as state school as you can get , we get about 500 less than what you ' re talking about at pitt .
our school does n ' t really care what we do at tournaments or how far away we are . we take our own cars to every tournament , even ones down in maryland . the money we get from our student association has to pay for jerseys , is supposed to help us with tournaments , etc .
every tournament our team goes to , we each pay 10 - 20 bucks out of pocket .
if you are an ultimate fr ##is ##bee team and sleeping in hotels . . . consider yourself as spoiled as an ultimate team gets in my opinion .
you got ta learn how to save money .
most tournaments will house you if you ask and explain your situation .
if we ca n ' t get housing , we camp out somewhere .
at bingham ##ton this year we threw up a tent on the high jump mat ( which i must say is very comfortable ) .
regional ##s 2 years ago , our team and about 7 others could n ' t afford housing at princeton so we camped way way out back on the fields and hung out all night .
for you northwestern guys , you really need to get in touch with someone at your school that will listen .
our school did n ' t like us for a long time , but we behaved ourselves , and very respectful ##ly approached various people , working our way up the ladder , about changing some policies .
start off low , and work your way up .
explain to them that if you are driving your own cars , you should be able to go wherever you want , and even throw in there if for any reason you bring shame to the university , you will go right back to the old policy no questions asked .
how often do you go to a tournament and whatever happens there gets back to administration ?
pretty much never so your safe with that offer .
another thing we did was have a lot of fundraiser ##s on campus , entered banner contests for sporting events , etc .
once the school saw that unlike a lot of clubs , we were bust ##ing our ass ##es to fund ##rai ##se and get involved with school activities , their whole attitude towards us changed .
sell discs , sell pin ##t glasses , then go to someone , more than one person , and show them what kind of effort you are putting in .
a lot of school officials do n ' t understand how structured ultimate actually is .
go in and explain to them about regional ##s not just being some little " get together " but actually be a championship series .
hope my ram ##bling gave you some ideas that might work ~ squirrel
ps clip ##board now , sean for the future ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !

re : renewal of marriage vows on carnival cruise
my wife and i were guests at a wedding on the carnival legend on new years eve 2003 .
all the guests were folks who had met the bride and groom ( an attractive young couple who were sailing alone ) virtually on cruise ##cr ##itic .
the wedding took place in the afternoon , before the ship set sail .
thus , the couple was actual married by a justice of the peace in the state of florida .
it was a great way to begin a cruise .
although i am not certain of this , i assume that renew ##ing your vows could actually be done while the ship was at sea , because it would not involve any legal issues .

i did n ' t think it was allowed any more , but 30 minutes until sailing an announcement was made that all non cruise guests must make their way to di ##se ##mba ##rk the ship prior to sailing .
i had never heard that announcement before so i assumed that it was for the people attending the wedding on board ?
this was the largest wedding gathering i have ever seen on board . . . maybe someone had connections ? ? ?
the bride was still visible later into the evening still wearing her wedding gown on the lid ##o deck !

re : renewal of marriage vows on carnival cruise
on 16 feb 2005 13 : 36 : 29 - 08 ##00 ,
we renewed our vows on carnival conquest on 10 / 31 / 2004 - you need to contact carnival wedding department and ask if they have any wedding / renewal packages available .
these usa ##lly take a little time to set up - if you are going in march i am not sure if / what would be available to you .
they were just starting a new renewal of vows program , which included all we rec ' d , but was cheaper .
since we had already paid for our package we kept it .
had a very nice ceremony with a justice of the peace and a small reception for the family members traveling with us .
call carnival wedding dept . at 1 ( 800 ) 93 ##3 - 49 ##6 ##8 or send an email to :

carnival corp - shareholder discount on princess
i ' m taking a 7 day cruise with princess in march and applied for my $ 100 carnival corp . shareholder onboard credit .
turns out that my travel agent has a ' group ' cruise on this ship and my $ 50 / pp credit due to the ' group ' cruise makes me ineligible for the shareholder credit .
this really makes a mock ##ery of the shareholder credit as almost every cruise has some sort of small credit attached .
$ 100 wo n ' t break the bank or make the cruise less enjoyable , nor will i stop being a shareholder , but i do find this sort of thing irritating .

this is incorrect .

it seems that some princess people are n ' t fully aware of the correct policy .

one other item . . . did you contact princess to submit your shareholder doc ##s ? the carnival office in florida only accepts doc ##s for carnival cruises . . . .
the other carnival properties have to be contacted directly to submit shareholder doc ##s .

re : carnival corp - shareholder discount on princess
you can get the larger of the ship ##board credits .
until recently you could combine the stock ##holder credits with the credits for booking on board , but not with those from your agent .
the most recent carnival report under shareholder benefit says , " not comb ##ina ##ble with any other ship ##board offer " .
therefore i recently sold my stock .

post - trip report - london
hi all ,
we * just * got back into washington last evening , after our brief 5 - day trip to london .
thanks for all of the responses to my earlier inquiries , i ' m happy to report that everything went pretty well , but both my wife and i are pretty beat / tired .
we got into heath ##row on monday morning .
at the airport , i got some cash from the barclay ##s atm just outside the arrival area , as many have suggested .
f ##yi , i just checked my bank account , and we got charged a $ 2 . 00 fee and the exchange rate was around $ 1 . 92 / gp ##b .
after that , we took the underground into london .
zone 1 - 6 all - day pass cost 5 . 40 gb ##p each .
that was pretty easy . . . the most difficult part was finding the hotel once we finally got off at the final tube station .
the hotel was nice enough to let us check in , even though we were a bit early ( we got in around 12 : 30 , normal check - in time was 14 : 30 ) , which we were really grateful for , after dragging our bags for a couple of hours .
after settling into the hotel room ( my wife is an " un ##pack everything - and - st ##ow it " type of person ) , we went to do a little exploring .
being that this was a holiday , a lot of the local places were closed ( including restaurants in the hotel ) , but we found a kind of combo news ##age ##nt / foods ##tore nearby , and we picked up a 5 gb ##p calling card ( for calling home ) and some drinks ( 1 . 59 gp ##b for ~ 2 liter pepsi light , . 98 gb ##p for a ~ 2 liter water ) .
it took us awhile , but we found a restaurant / pub ( white swan ) that was open .
it seemed like a kind of local place , and the woman that was running the place was very nice .
when we walked in , we stood around waiting to be seated : ) , and she said " this is a pub , sit anywhere , and order at the bar " .
i gathered ( from that and a few visits at other pubs ) that that ' s the norm .
anyway , we had a nice late lunch : fish and chips ( with " mas ##hed peas " ) for me , and a beef pie for my wife .
f ##yi , this was probably the most reasonable meal that we had during our whole visit .
that night , we walked around the area around the victoria underground station , because we were suppose to meet up with a tour the next morning .
while there , we found a local sai ##ns ##bury ( kind of a small supermarket ) about 2 blocks from the underground station , and stocked up on some cheese , milk , and cr ##ois ##sant ##s .
prices here were a bit cheaper than the local foods ##tore , and during our trip , i made several trips here : ) .
we were n ' t sure what we wanted to eat for dinner , so we just wandered around a bit , and finally ended up at a " steak ##house " near the station . . . big mistake .
the food , service , and prices were very bad . . . i guess we should have figured that one out when 3 other parties walked out after being seated , but unfortunately , we had already ordered , so we felt kind of ob ##liga ##ted to finish .
i do n ' t know if this is the case with all " steak ##houses " , but we stayed away from them all after that : ( .
we took an all day bus tour ( evan evans ) , including the london eye . took the underground to victoria , and walked to the victoria coach station ( it ' s not the same : ) ) .
i thought that the tour was a pretty good way to get introduced to part of the city .
we got to see a lot in a short time , including extended tours of westminster ( felt kind of strange walking over dead people ) and the tower of london ( neat ! ) .
this tour included lunch at another pub near tr ##af ##al ##gar square ( more beef pie ##s for us ) , and the tour guide was very good , and kind of funny .
it was kind of like travelling with a " grand dad " and he did his best to keep us all together .
at the end of the land tour , we went on ride on one of the thames cruise boats ( warning , it is freezing on the top deck . . . ) , and then a ride on the london eye .
all in all , recommended , but afterwards , both my wife and i agreed that an " all - day " tour was too exhaust ##ing ( even on a bus tour , you have to do a lot of walking especially getting to the changing of the guards and at the london tower ) , and we probably would ' ve preferred breaking it into 2 1 / 2 day tours .
we also took one of the hop - on / hop - off bus tours ( the " original " ) on one of the other day , as we thought it was the easiest way to get around to the places that we wanted to re - visit .
a couple of comments : take the one with the live guide if you can , as it ' s much more interesting than the ones with the recorded commentary ( you can ask questions ) .
also , if you want to get a seat on the top deck , take one of the earlier buses , as at least when we were there , it was impossible to get a seat on top later in the day , and you ca n ' t see much from the lower ( enclosed ) deck ( but it ' s much warmer : ) ! ) .
we had been buying the 2 - zone all - day tube passes ( 4 . 20 gb ##p each ) everyday , just to get around to dinner and shopping on our own , but by the time this was all over , my wife did n ' t feel like taking the underground back to heath ##row , so we had asked the hotel con ##ce ##ier ##ge to make a reservation on an airport bus ( 15 gb ##p each ) , but he instead offered that he could get us a private car direct to the airport for 35 gb ##p , which is what we did .
this was perfect , because it got us door - to - door from the hotel to l ##hr terminal 3 with no has ##sle ##s at all .
i would n ' t have done that from l ##hr to the hotel , but since the con ##cier ##ge was arranging it , i felt that it ' d be safe , and the driver turned out to be pretty nice .
overall , it was an enjoyable , but really exhaust ##ing trip ( we live in the suburbs , so i guess we ' re not use to walking everywhere ) .
luckily this was n ' t a " shopping " trip , because things are ( at least from americans ) really expensive .
i think that if i was dealing in gp ##bs all the time , it would n ' t seem so bad , but i remember sitting at the ice cream ( " gel ##ato " ? ) counter at ha ##rro ##ds , and watching two little kids , each eating some sun ##dae ##s that cost 15 gp ##b each ( $ 30 . 00 ) , and thinking " wow ! " . jim

angus steak ##house by any chance ?
i have never heard anything but bad stuff about them .
they are not british in the food sense , that ' s for sure .
pub food is usually a good bet in the uk .
that ' s a europe thing .
the cities invariably involve a lot of walking , and this is seen as a pleasure , not a task .
that ' s very expensive , even by london standards .
ha ##rro ##ds is ha ##rro ##ds though , and most people go there to be blown away by the prices .
of course everyone feels compelled to buy ' something ' .
i opted for a few chocolate ##s , which were very good .
good report of a good trip , even if you did fall for a couple of the tourist traps ! - - - - - d ##fm - - - - - -

comments on suggested travel plans through new england
hi all ,
i live in austin , tx , and being one who ' s only been as far as nashville , tn two friends and i are planning a trip to new england for a week .
i ' d love some insight or suggestions on our trip it ##iner ##ary - -
first i went to ex ##ped ##ia and did some flight checks .
we ' re planning on going july 4th week - - what better time to be in boston i figure : )
saturday , july 2nd - fly from austin , tx to boston and stay with friends living in boston
sunday , july 3rd - hang around boston and stay with friends
monday , july 4th - hang around boston and stay with friends
tuesday , july 5th - leave early and drive to niagara falls , ny - 46 ##7 miles - stay in niagara falls
wednesday , july 6th - leave from niagara falls and drive to toronto , on - 85 miles - drive back to niagara falls that evening - 85 miles - stay in niagara falls
thursday , july 7th - leave niagara falls and drive to red bank , ny - 435 miles - stay in red bank for the night - we want to hit - up jay and silent bob ' s silent st ##ash
friday , july 8th - drive back to boston passing through new york - - do whatever - - 262 miles from red banks to boston but add whatever miles from new york - stay the night with friends in boston
saturday , july 9th - fly back to austin
i figure staying in red bank , nj , which is n ' t far from nyc , is cheaper then staying in the city .
plus while driving back north to boston we can spend the day in nyc .
i know there ' s way too much to do , but i have another friend who works at the met i ' ll try to hook - up with . we ' ll plan our few hours in nyc wise ##ly .
also we ' re hanging in boston for so many nights to visit with the friends there and hit the sights in that area .
also this is a vacation , so we hope to spend some time just chilling .
any suggestions on changes ?
we have 3 people going , and ex ##ped ##ia shows the flight ( round trip ) and a rental car with unlimited miles being $ 143 ##0 , plus i ' m figuring about $ 150 for gas and at $ 120 a night for hotel that ' s $ 360 total for that .
so total cost ( without food , spending cash , parking , toll roads , etc ) is $ 1910 or about $ 63 ##7 each .
i ' m figuring about $ 850 per person should be plenty for everything - - and that ' s not bad for 7 nights in new en ##land with all the stuff we ' re planning .
did i miss anything or does anyone see any suggestions or changes that might either save money or make our trip more worth ##wil ##d ?
thanks again , and take care ,
ringo
oh - - what kinda weather can we expect up there during july ?
texas is in the 100 ' s normally , so i hope the averages for july in new england are a fare bit cooler : )

unless there ' s something in particular you want to see in toronto , i do n ' t see any reason to make this long side trip .
i would suggest heading back to red bank or wherever and trying to car ##ve out an extra day in new york city .
you can find hotels in your price range , especially with three sharing a room .
you might want to drop off the car somewhere near red bank , or as soon as you arrive in new york , if the drop off charges are n ' t too much . then you could spend part of one day in new york ( and a good part of the next day , assuming you dropped toronto ) .
then you could take the train or bus back to boston .
it might work out cheaper in the long run , especially when you consider the cost of parking in new york . - - barbara vaughan

re : comments on suggested travel plans through new england
.
hi everyone ,
thanks for all the great replies ! !
this is exactly what i ' m looking for : )
the main reason i ' d like to got ##o toronto and niagara falls is mainly because it ' s so close . . but i agree new york would be nice to spend a few days in .
i know the bulk of our trip is in boston , but we have friends living up there we hope to spend a few days with visiting .
the trip is both to visit with them and to spend time around new england .
as for gas , what is the going rate for gas right now in new england ? here in texas it ' s around $ 1 . 60 - $ 1 . 75 for reg un ##lea ##dded , but i ' m figuring $ 1 . 90 a gallon .
is this not accurate ?
here ' s how i figured the price i ' m factor ##ing in - - boston to niagara falls - 46 ##7 miles niagara falls to toronto - 85 miles and 85 miles back niagara falls to red bank , nj - 435 miles red bank , nj to boston ( plus spending some time in nyc ) - 262
total is 133 ##4 , but i ' m figuring 1500 with some extra for around nyc and various towns we visit .
we ' re getting a mid - sized vehicle , so if the car gets 20 mp ##g that ' s 75 gallons used .
this times $ 1 . 90 is $ 145 . 50 or around that .
even if gas is $ 2 . 00 a gallon that ' s still only around $ 150 , so i think $ 200 + for gas is a rather high estimate .
also is it possible to take a train from boston to nyc ?
if so how does that work or what ' s the cost ?
i am from texas where we drive everywhere , and i ' ve never even set foot on a train - - so forgive me if this is a weird question : )
thanks again for all the insight and help .
though i ' ve never been up there i ' ve always wanted to see both niagara falls and toronto , so being so close i almost hate to miss an opportunity .
take care ,

re : did you miss the inaugural address ?
the administration ' s approach to history is at odds with what has been described by a communications adviser to the president as the " reality - based community . " a dumb phrase , but not a dumb thought : he meant that the administration sees history as dynamic and change ##able , not static and imp ##er ##vious to red ##ire ##ction or improvement .
that is the bush administration way , and it happens to be realistic : history is dynamic and change ##able .
on the other hand , some things are constant , such as human imperfect ##ion , injustice , misery and bad government .
this world is not heaven .
the president ' s speech seemed rather heaven ##ish .
it was a god - drenched speech .
this president , who has been accused of giving too much attention to religious imagery and religious thought , has not let the criticism enter him .

again , this is not heaven , it ' s earth .
this is - - how else to put it ? - - over the top .
it is the kind of sentence that makes you wonder if this white house did not , in the preparation period , have a case of what i have called in the past " mission in ##eb ##riation . " a sense that there are few legitimate boundaries to the desires born in the goodness of their good hearts .
one wonders if they should n ' t ease up , calm down , breathe deep , get more securely grounded .

to put it simply ( for your benefit ) : lincoln spoke * of * god , demonstrating the irony of a war fought between people with more similarities ( their religious beliefs among them ) than differences . dub ##ya spoke * for * god , demanding that we should all fall in line behind him , because he ' s got the plan , and god ' s on his side .

my favorite part of the speech , though , is this line :

when is an election not an election ?
sunni ##s say iraq poll illegitimate .
are there minimal requirements before an election can be considered an legitimate election ?
the recent iraq election was boycott by the sunni ##s which constitute about 20 % of the population .
for example , in a city of 200 , 000 only 1400 had caste ##d their votes .
many of the 1400 were civil workers and police ##s are shi ##ites from the south .
in fall ##uj ##ah , there were 5 voting stations with only one vote caste ##d .
are their boycott reasonable ?
if so , should that affect the legitimacy of the election ? - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
sunni ##s say iraq poll illegitimate a leading group of iraqi sunni cleric ##s have said the country ' s landmark election lacks legitimacy as so many sunni ##s did not take part in the vote . the cleric ##s had encouraged sunni ##s to boycott the elections because of the presence of us and foreign troops .
the us and iraqi authorities , as well as the united nations , have hailed the election as a " victory for democracy " .
but the association of muslim scholars says any government elected in the poll will not reflect the people ' s will .
" these elections lack legitimacy because a large segment of different sect ##s , parties and currents with their influence in iraq boycott ##ed , " the association said in a statement .
" this necessarily means the coming national assembly and government that will emerge from it will not possess the legitimacy to enable them to draft the coming constitution , " it said .
the group said whilst it would respect the choice of iraqi ##s who had chosen to vote , it would regard the new government as having only limited powers .

re : when is an election not an election ?
sunni say the poll is now illegitimate because they chose not to vote .
fundamentally , choosing not to vote is actually a vote for the other side .
if you choose not to vote , then you choose to give your opponents all the power .
if the sunni ' s were prevented , or restricted or otherwise not allowed to vote , then they could claim ill ##eg ##iti ##mac ##y , but since the simply just collectively decided not to vote , then they declared the vote legitimate of their own vol ##ition while ##st simultaneously ce ##ding power to all non - sunni ##s .
if one slices off one ' s nose to spite their face , then nobody should be surprised about their complaints of bleeding .
this is another case of " well what did you bloody well expect to happen " ?

re : when is an election not an election ?
you are talking about physically restricted to vote at election day . however , it is not the sunni cleric ##s ' complaints .
rather , their state reason is related to the reality that iraq is currently under occupation .
does the presence of foreign troops makes them less free ?
were they consulted on setting the date of election and how to distribute seats from the votes gain ?
in addition , they are restricted from moving freely in their own country and / or their own city , would that not restricted their election related activities ?
well , i raised the question because the situation is novel .

re : when is an election not an election ?
their stated reason for not voting was because the country was under occupation .
they faced , however , no pressure from the rest of the country , nor from the " occupying " forces to stay away from the vote .
the sunni ' s now claim that the vote is not legitimate because they did n ' t vote .
it ' s not their right to decide the legitimacy of the vote .
the sunni ' s had all the power about a year ago .
then they , the minority , were toppled , and they used their power to int ##imi ##date and threaten shi ' it ##es through the entire period .
who do you think the insurgents were killing - - shi ' it ##es .

re : north korea says it has nuclear weapons
jim ,
the hm ##ong will not be sitting and watching from the side ##line .
america has positioned its pieces on the chess board of global domination very carefully .
here are the options :
1 .
the us will use hm ##ong american sentiments against lp ##dr as the starting point for a regime change in laos .
however , laos is not the goal ; check ##mate is the fall of china , and economic control of china . the us will support one or two hm ##ong individuals to speak out against lp ##dr human rights violation and chao fa resistance fighters .
with a pre ##ced ##ant set in iraq for pre ##em ##ptive attacks , laos will be taken overnight and become a source of in ##val ##ua ##ble logistics for u . s . military attacks on china .
2 .
the us ' s policy of handing out nt ##r will have the desired effect of reeling in alliances from the surrounding countries of china .
laos already has nt ##r .
we shall wait and see if chinese fat or american fat taste better to lp ##dr .
if lp ##dr plays ball with uncle sam , then there will be no blood ##shed in laos .
when the americans get into laos , the artificial cooperation will be sufficient for some strategic political changes .
some hm ##ong americans may be reintroduced to laos .
some hm ##ong in laos , namely , chao fa , will be a good source of intelligence on lao - china border activities .
this will be chao fa ' s chance to replace their diet of tree roots with rice and fish .
again , america has lp ##dr under its control , and america can launch airs ##tri ##kes and ground units from laos .
3 .
regardless of what happens , the u . s . has a direct ethnic connection to china by way of hm ##ong , which will secure cia - insurgency operations . unlike the current situation in the middle - east , where the number of arabic - speaking cia agents are few , there will be plenty of hm ##ong / chinese - speaking cia agents for disposal and use in the looming sino - us war .
perhaps by route of thailand , if lp ##dr does not cooperate , the us will inc ##ite insurrection in the southern provinces of china . these provinces have a lot of hm ##ong people , and have been known to be the fierce ##st opposition to chinese rule ( aka remember the mia ##o rebellion ##s ? ) .
this will be the hm ##ong ' s god - given chance to fight for their own country .
let ' s see if they ( and we ) agree to a coal ##tion government like the ku ##rds in iraq .
those are just 3 options .
they all involve hm ##ong people .
read between the lines , the war will not be between the us and north korea .
china is using north korea to es ##cala ##te sino - us relations and test uncle sam ' s temper .
i sure hope i am not sitting and watching when this all goes down .
this is the perfect opportunity .

en ##ron & amp ; india
in india , be ##cht ##el along with general electric are the new owners of the notorious and currently defunct en ##ron power project .
the en ##ron contract , which legally binds the government of the state of maharashtra to pay en ##ron a sum of 30 billion dollars , was the largest contract ever signed in india .
en ##ron was not shy to bo ##ast about the millions of dollars it had spent to " educate " indian politicians and bureau ##crats .
the en ##ron contract in maharashtra , which was india ' s first ' fast - track ' private power project , has come to be known as the most massive fraud in the country ' s history .
( en ##ron was another of the republican party ' s major campaign contributors ) .
the electricity that en ##ron produced was so ex ##or ##bit ##ant that the government decided it was cheaper not to buy electricity and pay en ##ron the mandatory fixed charges specified in the contract .
this means that the government of one of the poor ##est countries in the world was paying en ##ron 220 million us dollars a year not to produce electricity !
now that en ##ron has ceased to exist , be ##cht ##el and ge are sui ##ng the indian government for 5 . 6 billion us dollars .
this is not even a minute fraction of the sum of money that they ( or en ##ron ) actually invested in the project .
once more , it ' s a projection of profit they would have made had the project materialized .

re : en ##ron & amp ; india
for a slightly different perspective :
" maharashtra officials say the cost of power supplied by en ##ron is nearly double the tariff charged by indian power producers , and used it as an excuse to stop paying state debts to the plant . "
" en ##ron had signed a power purchase agreement with power utility ms ##eb eight years ago , under which a $ 3 ##bn 2 , 182 mega ##wat ##t power plant was to be commissioned .
but the project ran into trouble nearly two years ago with the indian authorities beginning to delay payments saying en ##ron ' s power tariff was too high . . . though en ##ron officials refuse to talk about the price they would be willing to sell their stake at , analysts say the us company is demanding about one billion dollars for its investments in india .
so far it has only got offers of about half that amount from indian companies and financial institutions , but en ##ron is unwilling to sell its stake at a price lower than the cost .
in case no satisfactory offer comes from the indian side , en ##ron will have little option but to go for international arbitration as their investments in the country were guaranteed by the indian government .
but arbitration proceedings can be a long and messy affair . analysts say both india and en ##ron have little to gain from a pro ##tracted legal battle .
the best way out could be a compromise by which en ##ron gets less than what it is demanding and more than what the indians are presently offering .
io ##w : no fraud , just a basic business dispute , in which the party rene ##ging on its obligations is the gov ' t of maharashtra . the maharashtra officials are either inc ##omp ##ete ##nt fools , or worse - malicious fraud ##sters who con ##ned an international coma ##p ##ny into building a state - of - the - art power plant for them at a cost of billions of dollars , and then refused payment , knowing the company has no legal rec ##ours ##e except lengthy international arbitration , and will likely sell the plant to them for a fraction of its true value .

iraq elections at this point

iraq elections at this point
this is getting strange .
i actually ca n ' t recall it ever taking 2 weeks to " count " these many ballots , generally elections are called within 24 hours .
in this case counting is taking 2 weeks .
what is strange is everyone knows who won , sis ##tani won .
his party , the major winner , could not field can ##ida ##tes until just before the election , but it was his face on all the poster and his part wi ##pped up the heavily funded us supported government .
so we have the voice of the people of iraq , even if the sunni ' s had voted sis ##tani would still be the majority leader .
but he was not running .
so the us has entered in to the classic shia quick ##san ##d of islamic republics , which have caused it such problems in iran .
sis ##tani will run iraq , or the election will be ignored .
the problem with sis ##tani running iraq is he refuses to talk to the am ##ei ##rca ##ns , and as the real power broker what ever figure heads take the pm and other posts will speak with as little authority as their counter parts in iran .
the us is now fighting a war for a nation who government they have no direct ties with .
the other option , and what the us seems to be trying , is to somehow fu ##dge the election so sis ##tani does not win , that raise doubts about the outcome , claiming fraud , do anything so that the election causes to results .
given the american attention span is about 10 min ##uts the creation of a dictatorship of us puppets against the election would be ignored in the us .
this would actually be not only in the us best interest , but might be mil ##ita ##rily necessary .
i ca n ' t imagine how the us occupation could operate in a situation where sis ##tani has the ultimate power .
in the long run i ca n ' t see how iraq can avoid civil war , since its had it so many times in the past .
civil war leading to the victory of one group is the norm in iraq , and was the cas ##ue of most mass graves in the 1980s and 1990s .
likely only sanctions have killed more .
sis ##tani has the popular support and the claim of the election which the am ##ei ##rca ##ns bun ##gled bad ##dly and allowed him to take over .
the sunni ' s have the weapons , the skill , and the support .
the us occupation is becoming more difficult by the day and bush has shown he fails to understand the situation .
hell when the worst possible event in the election was happening , sis ##tani was flooding the polls with his supporters bush was crow ##ing .
sadly bush ' s concerns are short - term politics in the south of am ##ei ##rca , and they have already decided they do n ' t have to pay attention to iraq .
with more and mm ##ore sunni supporting the insurgents iran , the big winner in all of this , will feel the need to back sis ##tani in the south . so if the us leaves its possible we could see iraq carved up between the groups .
as for a civil war , its already started .

re : iraq elections at this point
it is pretty bizarre , considering how long they had to organize elections .
it may be that they want the public to get adjusted to the fact that the shia ' s are taking over before announcing official results . the us is not going to change the results .
a shia government will allow us an exit strategy .
all we have won in iraq is maybe a shaky neutrality .
its not like germany or japan where they were so terrified of the soviets post war that they were happy to see the us stick around . i myself would have been happier with a mu ##sha ##ri ##ff military dictatorship or junta taking over .
that is the only way to keep religion out of running the government .
in my opinion , all we have to the average iraqi citizen is brought a new type of domination . many small businesses will have to close down ( alcohol related ) women will have to dress head to toe again , etc . there is only one ray of hope , that sis ##tani will prove a very strong leader and actually care about the moderate muslims in his country and protect them .
its a wait and see game as for the sunni ##s , they are probably going to have to be crushed .

re : u . s . provoked japan ?
i ' ve read quite a few more rational works describing how the us was doing its best to avoid , or at the very least post ##pone , a war against japan , mainly because f ##dr was trying to provoke hitler to war and did n ' t need a distraction on another distant front .
work ?
( stuff deleted )
the thesis has been expo ##und ##ed by several conspiracy theorists , mainly the ones who expo ##und ##ed that f ##dr knew pearl harbor was about to be attacked , and let it happen .
one of their " proof ##s " was that the us carriers were out of port during the attack , and " everybody knew " carriers were the capital ship of the future .
however , the two carriers operating out of pearl at the moment were sent west with light escort , on possibly intersecting routes with the i ##jn kid ##o but ##ai , which had far more carriers and a far heavier escort . even stranger , the uss enterprise was scheduled to be at pearl by dec 6th , but got delayed by a storm .
consequently , for the ph conspiracy theorists to believe that f ##dr kept the carriers out of harm ' s way , we not only have to grant f ##dr the full knowledge of kid ##o but ##ai ' s route of approach would not result in either us ##n carrier fleet getting caught in a hopeless battle , but that f ##dr could psychic ##ally manipulate the weather to prevent hal ##sey from sailing into pearl and thus be ambushed .
to make a very long story short , it is foolish to assume that the us wanted to go to war against japan prior to 1941 , considering the weight of evidence arguing against a us desire for war , and the overwhelming lack of evidence ( not to mention rational thought ) arguing for a us desire for war . - -

re : u . s . provoked japan ?
here ' s something i wrote as part of a larger article , some while ago :
was n ' t japan just defending herself when she attacked the us ?
this line of reasoning seems to derive from arguments that japan was being " driven into a corner " by sanctions , and had no choice but to attack the us .
meiji japan was driven to em ##ulate what it thought the west was doing in every face ##t of society .
they had observed , for example , that the west was able to car ##ve up china into " spheres of influence " , and was able to do from great distances , while they , the japanese , had had limited success in their previous attempts to dominate the korean peninsula , much less china .
as part of the catch - up effort , she whole - hearted ##ly entered into the imperial ##ist game in asia , being treated as an equal ( relative to her power ) by the other powers .
however , after world war i , japan failed to recognize a fundamental shift in the attitudes of her former imperial partners ; they began a long , slow process of di ##sen ##ga ##ging themselves from their former imperial areas , from their colonies , in addition to outright stopping all expansion ##s .
japan chose to read this as a sign that the west had lost its power and resolve , and that japan was the rightful heir to imperial mantle in asia .
with the deaths of many of the ideal ##istic leaders who had led japan ' s rise to international prominence , and the refusal of the us to intervene in asian affairs , in addition to the bolshevik revolution and the stripping of possessions from germany , britain found herself alone in dealing with an increasingly aggressive japan in the area .
having a keen grasp of the obvious , she began a policy of acc ##eding to japanese he ##ge ##mony in the area .
japan continued a policy of acquiring territory for some grand , ill ##us ##ive scheme of a " greater asia " , subordinate and grateful to japan .
the reality of this was that only a single possession , manchu ##ria , was profitable to the japanese , and the rest of the empire turned out to be a drain .
this drain was greatly accelerated by japan ' s invasion of china proper in 1936 .
it was a war that japan assumed would be ended in " 3 to 6 months " ; at the time of pearl harbor , it had been going on for 5 years , at the cost of over half a million japanese lives .
the war put a tremendous strain on japan ( and was in fact opposed by more radically nationalist ##ic elements , as taking away from the development of japan ' s other possessions , particularly in the areas of scrap metal and fuel . ) domestic consumption fell , consumer goods became scarce , and the use of material ##e for war purposes ate into japan ' s domestic industry .
this cut further into her foreign reserves , ex ##ace ##rba ##ting the economic impact of the war .
the war effort took on a life of its own , however , and common sense was subordinate ##d to it .
japan expanded into areas of china and indochina which had no strategic value to her , but put her in a position to threaten british and dutch possessions in the area ; possessions that both those allied nations needed in order to continue their fight against hitler .
at this point , the us stopped ignoring the japanese threat , and imposed a series of es ##cala ##ting sanctions on japan , cutting off her scrap metal , limit ##ting and then cutting off her oil ( japan imported most of both from the us . ) while japanese officials realized that they had enough of each resource for japan to do well if the war in china stopped , they were powerless over the military they were supposed to control .
an ab ##ort ##ive attack on soviet positions in mongolia had placed japan ' s focus firmly south , towards the possessions of the us ' future allies .
for no reason anyone could art ##iculate , japan felt she had to continue the war in china .
to continue the war in china , she had to have resources of oil and metal .
to have these resources , she must seize them , if others refused to sell them .
in order to seize them , she felt she had to attack and destroy the naval power of the us .
thus , for a " 3 to 6 month " operation in china in 1937 , japan would embark on a war that would strip her of all the possessions and industries she had acquired in 70 years .

the 1860 presidential election
in 1860 there was a four - way race between the republican party with abraham lin ##col ##d , the democratic party with stephen douglas , the southern democratic party with john br ##eck ##en ##ridge , and the constitutional union party with john bell .
lincoln won a plurality with about 40 % of the vote . wi it was only a two - way race between lincoln and douglas ?

" one feature of the result must not be omitted .
many careless observers felt at the time that the success of lincoln was due entirely to the fact of there having been three opposing candidates in the field ; or , in other words , to the di ##ssen ##sions in the democratic party , which divided its vote between br ##eck ##in ##ridge and douglas .
what merely moral strength the democratic party would have gained had it remained united , it is impossible to estimate .
such a su ##pp ##osition can only be based on the absence of the extreme southern doctrines concerning slavery .
given the presence of those doctrines in the canvas ##s , no hypothesis can fur ##nish a result different from that which occurred .
in the contest upon the questions as they existed , the victory of lincoln was certain .
if all the votes given to all the opposing candidates had been concentrated and cast for a ' fusion ticket , ' as was wholly or partly done in five states , the result would have been changed nowhere except in new jersey , california , and oregon ; lincoln would still have received but 11 fewer , or 169 electoral votes - - majority of 35 in the entire electoral college . " abraham lincoln , a history , volume 2 by john george nicola ##y and john hay
see for a confirmation of the electoral arithmetic : the states where lincoln got an ab ##ol ##ute majority of the popular vote ( i . e . , all the free states except oregon , california , and new jersey ) were sufficient to bring him a majority in the electoral college .
the reason that lincoln could get an electoral majority with only forty percent of the popular vote was not that his opposition was divided but that he had far fewer " wasted " votes than his opponents - - in ten southern states he got no popular votes at all .
it can of course be argued that the candidate of a united anti - lincoln opposition might have done better than all the ot ##l anti - lincoln candidates combined , because the mere fact of the divided nature of lincoln ' s opposition might have discouraged anti - lincoln men and led to fewer of them voting than would otherwise be the case .
but given that turnout was quite high in 1860 , i doubt this .
one thing seems reasonably clear to me : if there was to be a united anti - lincoln opposition , douglas could not lead it .
he was hated too much in the south for his opposition to the admission of kansas as a state under the pro - slavery le ##com ##pton constitution and for his interpretation of dr ##ed scott as still allowing territories to exclude slavery through un ##fr ##ien ##dly local legislation .
( see
for douglas ' s defense of his position . ) he and br ##eck ##in ##ridge and bell would have to withdraw in favor of a compromise candidate - - former governor horatio seymour of new york was one proposal .
but i doubt that seymour would have been able to do better than all the combined ot ##l anti - lincoln candidates in such close states as illinois and indiana and his own state of new york was not really close enough for me to believe he could have taken that state from the lincoln column . - - david ten ##ner dt ##en . . . @ am ##eri ##tech . net

holocaust day
yet again i notice that the media see gay ##s as ' invisible ' when it comes to holocaust day . this morning , when talking about the horrors of aus ##wi ##tch on the bbc breakfast programme , they referred to the slaughter of thousands of jews and others .
surely gay ##s and g ##yp ##sies warrant more than to be referred to as ' others ' .
you would n ' t know anything about the slaughter of gay ##s if you only listened to the bbc .

hello thomas ,
as mentioned in " the final solution " thread , the number of men killed for being homosexual was at the most 10 - 15 , 000 .
now that ' s significant , but compared to the genocide of jews and z ##ige ##une ##r it ' s not as significant ( though of course to the family and loved ones of those who died every single one is significant ) .

this is a bit like rating stalin and hitler for bad ##ness purely on the grounds of the number of deaths they were responsible for .
it ' s " significant " if any group of people is identified for liquidation by the government of the country in which they live , surely ?
if there are n ' t as many identifiable individuals from a particular group in the general population , then by your significance = head ##co ##unt yards ##tick some groups are never ever going to get rated as " significant " .
in some ways , it is amazing that the nazis were able to identify even * two * thousand homosexual ##s in the thirties .

i ' m simply trying to get some perspective .
the holocaust of the jews and z ##ige ##une ##r was motivated by racial prejudice ##s .
the murder of ( at the most ) 10 ##k homosexual ##s was n ' t .
most homosexual ##s arrested during the nazi era were imprisoned in normal jail ##s .
if you were homosexual ##ly oriented but did nothing with it the law in 30 ##s germany could n ' t touch you .
the jews and z ##ige ##une ##r on the other hand were killed simply for their onto ##logical state .

hang on a moment up there you say
it ' s sh ##run ##k , i think your agenda is showing !
and that previous quote says
a rather important qualification .
i think the chance of their being only 1000 ##0 who were homosexual amongst the how ever million were killed in the camps is rather small .
records appear to show that 5000 ##0 _ men _ were convicted of homosexuality during the nazi rule , finding out how many were sent to a camp and killed there is more difficult especially as some who were sent to normal jail ##s were transferred to camps at the end of their sentence , but 10 - 15 ##k seems reasonable

october ' s last weekend
scott
2004 - 11 - 01 ##t ##11 : 44 : 00 again i apologize for the lack of updates over the past few days and will use this space to rec ##ap a weekend that was both good and bad .
the good :
on friday a small group of friends and i attended a most - righteous sister hazel concert at floyd ' s music store for the third straight , and for the third straight year i was blown away by one of my favorite live bands .
sister hazel has a way of becoming intimate with the fans by br ##ining them into the show .
it ' s something you can always expect from these guys , unlike so many other performers , and is why i never miss a show when they ' re in town .
on saturday we hosted what was for the most part a largely successful halloween party - - save for the fake blood stains on the carpet and bathroom walls , a couple beer spill ##s , unnecessary fights and the expected trash ##ing of the kitchen and living room areas .
naturally , i dressed up as hugh he ##f ##ner and took the role of making sure everyone was having a good time .
i have yet to hear any complaints from any of the guests .
the bad :
on saturday the seminole ##s were best ##ed by un ##rank ##ed maryland ; effectively ending our chances at a national title this year .
in addition , the quarterback controversy has once again de ##bo ##uche ##d as chris ri ##x almost took us to victory with his deep threat .
ala ##s , too little too late was the case thanks to the in ##ept wyatt sex ##ton who has been our starter since replacing ri ##x earlier in the season .
fortunately the agony of defeat was blanket ##ed somewhat by our halloween party and i wo n ' t have to worry about seminole football until next saturday .
on sunday we saw " saw " ( review coming ) and as expected i was less than satisfied .
it was neither better nor worse than last week ' s " the gr ##udge " but the trailers beforehand di ##cta ##te that the end of this year and the beginning of 2005 will bring us a large quantity of horror movies .
if i enjoy one out of five considering the genre i can say it ' s worth it .

they refuse to reason
scott
2004 - 11 - 01 ##t ##18 : 06 : 00 i wish i could have been at a pub , or wherever these people con ##ven ##e , to see the reactions from all the brit ##ons who read the telegraph this morning ( emphasis added ) : britain ' s gun laws are aimed at the wrong target , curb ##ing and criminal ##ising legal ownership while failing to tackle huge rises in shooting offences over the past few years , according to an international firearms legislation expert .
prof gary ma ##user said that britain was making the same mistake as canada and australia in focusing on legal owners - a section of the law - ab ##idi ##ng community where gun crimes , such as the dun ##bla ##ne massacre , were abe ##rra ##tions .
the home office and police chiefs should instead tackle the possession of guns in criminal hands , said prof ma ##user , a member of the independent fraser institute in canada .
he has given evidence to select committees of the house of commons and the canadian senate and predicted the es ##cala ##tion of gun crime on britain ' s streets .
his warning comes as gun crime incidents are averaging about 29 a day in england and wales , more than twice the level of when the labour government came to power in 1997 .
in the past two years , there have been cases of school ##child ##ren and a baby , killed or injured by guns .
" i believe that factors of political correct ##ness are at work , " he said .
" police crack ##down ##s , home office initiatives and over - regulation of legally held weapons create fr ##oth and they may even fool the police themselves into believing they are doing something about gun crime . "
prof ma ##user added : " the sad truth is that while the police officers are inspecting farmers ' gun cabinets to see if they comply with regulations somewhere in the uk , someone , who has not filled in a firearms certificate form , will be smuggling a gun into the country or selling one to an inner city youth . "
recorded gun crime rose by three per cent to 10 , 590 incidents in the year to june .
two - thirds of gun crime takes place in london , birmingham and manchester .
it does n ' t matter to these people that crime has sky ##rock ##ete ##d since the irrational ban on private gun possession went into effect in great britain .
just as long as it ' s there , they feel safe .

not to be ignored

2004 - 12 - 01 ##t ##23 : 13 : 00 more than a few e - mail ##s have come in wondering why i have n ' t remarked on the horrible hunting tragedy on nov . 21 that left six people dead , and why i have n ' t updated the assault weapons ban counter .
i did n ' t mean to wait this long and never intended to ignore the issue , but i have been extremely busy last week with thanksgiving and everything that goes along with it .
this is problem that needs to be addressed .
but as for the assault weapons ban issue , the man accused of the brutal killings , cha ##i van ##g of st . paul , min ##n , used a russian - built sai ##ga 7 . 62 mm , sk ##s semi ##au ##tom ##atic rifle .
as this article points out , the sk ##s was n ' t included on the list of banned weapons as part of the 10 - year ban on certain " assault weapons " signed by president clinton .
the ban expired in september and at the time of this posting , no one has been killed by any one of those weapons since the ban expired .
but let ' s talk about this case , as i ' m sure discussions have started and many want stronger gun control because of this freak incident .
while the media use words like " military style , " " assault " and " semi ##au ##tom ##atic , " the gun used in the sl ##ay ##ings was not unlike a typical hunting rifle .
the sk ##s is a medium - powered car ##bine equipped with a 10 - round magazine , just like the pistol i ' m displaying in the photo on the left hand side of this blog .
banned weapons had capacities of more than 10 rounds ; so like my small 9 mm , the sk ##s was not classified as an " assault " weapon .
so let ' s not center our discussion around the gun , let ' s talk about the person behind the trigger .
if convicted of the killings , van ##g faces life in prison as minnesota does not honor the death penalty .
i look forward to van ##g ' s conviction and i pray for the families of the victims .
what happened was ind ##efe ##ns ##ible and justice must be served .

from bbc news : a retired italian doctor has revealed for the first time how he invented a fictitious disease which fooled the nazis during world war ii .
the trick of pre ##sc ##ri ##bing jews with a mysterious illness terrified the nazis and saved 45 roman jews .
dr vittorio sac ##er ##dot ##i has told his remarkable tale on the 60th anniversary of liberation of rome .
just 28 years old at the time , he used courage and ing ##en ##uity to save 45 people from certain death .
as other jews were being rounded up , dr sac ##er ##dot ##i admitted anyone who could reach the hospital as patients - and diagnosed them with a dangerous disease .
" we would write on their medical forms that the patient was suffering from k syndrome , " he said .
" we called it k after the german commander ke ##sser ##ling - the nazis thought it was cancer or tuberculosis , and they fled like rabbits . "
k syndrome saved his cousin , lucian ##a sac ##er ##dot ##i , who was just 10 years old .
" the day the nazis came to the hospital , someone came to our room and said : ' you have to cough , you have to cough a lot because they are afraid of the coughing , they do n ' t want to catch an awful disease and they wo n ' t enter ' . "

protect yourself not in san francisco

2004 - 12 - 15 ##t ##23 : 02 : 00 from the associated press : city residents will vote next year on a proposed weapons ban that would deny handgun ##s to everyone except law enforcement officers , members of the military and security guards .
if passed next november , residents would have 90 days to give up firearms they keep in their homes or businesses .
the proposal was immediately dismissed as illegal by a gun owners group .
firearms would be allowed only for police officers , security guards , members of the military , and anyone else " actually employed and engaged in protecting and preserving property or life within the scope of his or her employment , " according to the measure .
gun owners of california , a sacramento - based lobbying group , quickly called the ban illegal .
sam par ##edes , the group ' s executive director , said state law bars local governments from us ##ur ##ping the state ' s authority to regulate firearms .
" the amazing thing is they are going to turn san francisco into ground zero for every criminal who wants to profit at their chosen profession , " par ##edes said .
washington , d . c . , is the only major american city that currently ban ##s handgun possession by private citizens .
andrew ar ##ula ##nan ##dam , director of public affairs for the national rifle association , said san francisco would be re ##mis ##s to use that city as a model .
" if gun control worked , washington , d . c . , would be the beacon . however , it ' s the murder capital of the united states , " he said .
if approved , the weapons ban would take effect in january 2006 .
quote of the day : " firearms would be allowed only for police officers , security guards , members of the military , and anyone else actually employed and engaged in protecting and preserving property or life within the scope of his or her employment . "
so preserving property or life within the scope of self - defense and protection of the home is not allowed .
no thanks .
if the people vote for this measure it will be hard to sy ##mp ##athi ##ze with them when robbery and rape rates sky ##rock ##et , because bu ##rg ##ular ##s will know homes are not guarded , and rap ##ists will know the only thing stopping them from the victim they desire is their own inhibition ##s .

the baby was in good condition saturday .
lisa m . montgomery , 36 , of mel ##vern , kan . , was arrested later friday and charged with kidnapping resulting in death .
bobbie jo st ##inn ##ett , 23 , was found thursday in a pool of blood inside her small white home in ski ##dm ##ore , a town in northwest missouri .
st ##inn ##ett , who was eight months pregnant , had earlier been talking with her mother on the phone , and hung up saying a woman she had chat ##ted with online had just arrived at her door , authorities said .
u . s . attorney todd graves said montgomery contacted st ##inn ##ett through an online message board , and authorities zero ##ed in on her using computer forensic ##s .
montgomery was seeking to buy a dog from st ##inn ##ett , who raised rat terri ##ers , he said .
according to the criminal complaint , montgomery traveled about 40 miles to top ##eka , kan . , on thursday to go shopping .
her husband received a call from her saying she had gone into labor and given birth .
the next day , authorities say , montgomery confessed that she strangled st ##inn ##ett from behind , cut her open , removed the baby and cut her um ##bil ##ical cord . i do n ' t understand how we can call this fe ##tus - thing that was ripped from a mother ' s womb a " child " or " girl " in a society that sanctions partial - birth abortion .
if you ca n ' t charge someone for killing a fe ##tus via abortion during the eighth month , then surely you ca n ' t make a big deal about a woman who kidnapped a fe ##tus that survived the kn ##if ##ing .
on a less - sarcastic note , i pray for the family of the 23 - year - old woman .
no one should have to die because some crazy nut wanted a child and decided to kill for it .
if there ' s any good news in this story , it ' s that victoria jo will live on and carry her mother ' s memory .
question for the pro - choice ##rs : being that it is n ' t yet the ninth month , can we still charge the killer with kidnapping ?

democrats finally getting it right on abortion ?
scott
2004 - 12 - 23 ##t ##14 : 49 : 00 this is absolutely amazing news .
finally , the democrats are finally realizing that the american people support the rights of un ##born children and may soon rev ##amp their platform to accommodate the morals and values that at least half of this country possesses .
of course , i ' m sure the democrats would also like to start winning elections again .
from the los angeles times : after long defining itself as an und ##is ##puted defender of abortion rights , the democratic party is suddenly locked in an internal struggle over whether to red ##ef ##ine its position to appeal to a broader array of voters .
the fight is a central theme of the contest to head the democratic national , particularly between two leading candidates : former vermont gov . howard dean , who supports abortion rights , and former indiana rep . tim roe ##mer , an abortion foe who argues that the party can not rebound from its losses in the november election unless it shows more tolerance on one of society ' s most emotional conflicts .
no democrat with any respect for his un ##rave ##ling party would ever mention howard dean ' s name again .
the fact that he did n ' t win a single primary outside his home state shows that the country does not embrace his radical liberalism .
of course outspoken organizations such as planned parent ##hood , which gives a lot of money to democrats , will fight with everything they ' ve got to keep the democratic platform as liberal as possible .
results from the last few elections suggest that would n ' t be such a good idea if they ever want to gain more power in congress .

as a result , only about 100 girls are born for every 119 boys , because couples traditionally favor males .
beijing has set a goal of rev ##ers ##ing the im ##balance by 2010 , and to do this they will outlaw the selective abortion of female fe ##tus ##es to correct an im ##balance in the ratio of boys to girls .
so now by killing the males they can hopefully narrow the gender gap .
what a country !
from reuters : sex - selective abortion is already banned but technologies such as ultrasound have made it easier to know a baby ' s gender in advance , increasing the chances for ab ##ort ##ing girls .
despite a desire to curb the sex im ##balance and a relaxation in recent years that allows rural families to have two children if the first is a girl , china has shown no sign of abandoning the one - child policy and cracks down on those who advocate against it .
one such activist is mao hen ##gf ##eng , who was dismissed in 1988 from her job at a shanghai soap factory after becoming pregnant a second time .
last april , the shanghai public security bureau sentenced her to 18 months in a labor camp for campaigning against the one - child policy .

from sun - sent ##inal : two of the three types of free condoms offered by planned parent ##hood received poor ratings , according to rankings that appear in the february issue of consumer reports , which hits news ##stand ##s wednesday .
planned parent ##hood has since redesigned its " honey ##de ##w " condom , which was the magazine ' s lowest - ranked brand with two " poor " ratings in strength and reliability .
the group res ##ub ##mit ##ted all three of its brands for independent testing and received " excellent results , " said karen pearl , president and chief executive of planned parent ##hood of nassau county .
the group ' s " ass ##orted colors " brand was ranked next - to - last with a " poor " mark for strength but an " excellent " for reliability .
the " lo ##lli ##pop " got an overall " excellent " rating .
pretty scary that poorly rated condoms have been available to teens , both those looking for free sex and those who happen to attend public school .
even worse , it took a whistle ##bl ##ower to get planned parent ##hood to strengthen its product .
lo ##lli ##pop anyone ?

new ##do ##w argued that saying a christian prayer at the jan . 20 ceremony would violate the constitution by forcing him to accept unwanted religious beliefs .
attorneys representing bush and his inaugural committee argued that prayers have been widely accepted at inaugural ##s for more than 200 years and that bush ' s decision to have a minister rec ##ite the in ##vocation was a personal choice the court had no power to prevent .
forcing him to accept unwanted religious beliefs ?

the fda may decide as soon as this week whether drug stores can sell the emergency contra ##ception known as plan b without a prescription to women age 16 and older .
here is where i break with my conservative base and support the availability of plan b which can prevent pregnancy for up to 72 hours after sex .
with an 89 % success rate , we can be optimistic that we are on the right path to ending unwanted pregnancy that does n ' t involve a scalp ##el or su ##ction tube .
conservatives say people will be less reluctant to have risky and un ##pro ##tec ##ted sex if they ' ve got a box of b under the nightstand where condoms traditionally collect .
but i would rather plan b be used to prevent pregnancy than the liberals ' preferred method ; a fork in the head and a knife to the spinal cord .

without comment , justices let stand a lower court ruling that said south carolina ' s license plates , which bear the slogan " choose life , " violate the first amendment because abortion rights supporters were n ' t given a similar forum to express their beliefs .

now the first amendment guarantees all sides a fair voice ?

but a new cnn / usa today / gall ##up poll suggests more people side with the president .

78 percent said u . s . policy in iraq is had ##ing in the right direction , a 12 percentage point increase over pre - speech polling .
overall , 77 percent of respondents said bush is taking the country in the right direction after the speech compared to 67 percent beforehand .
and who was n ' t moved by the embrace of mother of a soldier killed in iraq and the daughter of a man killed by saddam hussein ' s regime ?
it was a beautiful moment last night that resulted in the longest standing o ##vation of the evening .

not that i was surprised - considering not long ago we were introduced to a people who proudly don ##ned the " i had an abortion " slogan with great pride on their t - shirts .
the first track ##back entry is from the typical anti - christian variety :
ms . ry ##tel is absolutely correct , the anti - abortion christians have managed to con ##vic ##e ( sic ) nearly everyone that abortion is wrong and people should feel horribly guilty over it .
like we have n ' t heard this ran ##t before .
yes , only the christians value life when it ' s a life before birth .
of course it would be wrong to make people feel " horribly guilty " over abortion , but celebrating the skull - cracking procedure " for the sake of the child " in the form of t - shirts and jewelry is to be admired . the problem for the pro - abortion movement is that hardly anyone is taking a stand to reverse this societal brain ##wash ##ing .
even by calling the movement " pro - choice " instead of " pro - abortion , " it gives cr ##ede ##nce to the christian lo ##oni ##es .
here is where i agree with my fellow libertarian .
" pro - choice " is a soft and weak label for what those people really truly represent .

the gun ##man began shooting inside the hudson valley mall shortly after 3 p . m . in kingston , nearly 90 miles north of new york city .
the 24 - year - old gun ##man went into a best buy store and started firing . when he ran out of ammunition , he was captured by mall employees , police said .
ulster town supervisor fred wa ##d ##no ##la identified the gun ##man ' s weapon as an ak - 47 assault rifle .

whoa !
you ' re telling me someone was able to take an ak - 47 " assault rifle " into a mall and in ##jure people ? !
but it ' s new york .
they have gun laws !
and because new york has such strict gun laws - meaning citizens are prohibited from conceal ##ing weapons - a gunner can use bag - to ##ting shop ##pers as target practice because guns laws keep mall shop ##pers at his mercy .
had an armed civilian been inside the mall , perhaps he could have intervened before the suspect began injuring people before he ran out of am ##mo .

not wise to attack fl ##ori ##dian ##s
scott
2005 - 02 - 24 ##t ##12 : 07 : 00 from the st . pete times : some florida legislators want to give people the right to shoot an attacker in a public place .
a house committee voted wednesday to allow people to shoot to kill in self - defense if they are attacked " in any other place where he or she has a right to be . " sponsored by rep . dennis ba ##xley , an o ##cala republican , the bill ( h ##b 249 ) passed 13 - 0 .
state law defines deadly force as that which is likely to cause " death or great bodily harm , " such as firing a gun at a person or a vehicle .
florida courts consider deadly force a last resort and have held that a person being attacked has the " duty to use every reasonable means to avoid the danger , including retreat , prior to using deadly force . "
but this legislation says a person who is under attack in a public place " has no duty to retreat .
"
" law - ab ##idi ##ng people should not be told that if they are attacked , they should turn around and run , " nr ##a lobby ##ist marion hammer told law ##makers . " this bill gives back rights that have been eroded and taken away by a judicial system that at times appears to give prefer ##ential treatment to criminals . "
ba ##xley held up a stack of more than 800 e - mail ##s from fl ##ori ##dian ##s who he said have written him to support the bill .
he said 62 house members , a majority , have endorsed his bill , and supporters include attorney general charlie cr ##ist and groups representing florida sheriff ##s , police chiefs and police officers .
rep . jeff ko ##tt ##kam ##p , r - cape coral , said the bill reminded him of a sign he saw on a constituent ' s house while campaigning door - to - door . ko ##tt ##kam ##p said the sign , next to a doorbell , showed a smoking . 44 - magnum handgun and the words : " we do n ' t dial 911 .
" this is great news for florida gun carriers because now to defend yourself you do n ' t have to first make sure a " duty to retreat " is impossible .
currently , if one ' s life is threatened he / she must make sure it is impossible to escape before using deadly force on an attacker .

2005 - 02 - 24 ##t ##22 : 52 : 00 164 days after the ex ##piration of the federal " assault weapons " ban some lunatic opened fire with an ak - 47 outside a texas courthouse .
a brave civilian with a concealed weapons permit tried to stop him but was gunn ##ed down by david hernandez arroyo sr , the sc ##umb ##ag who happened to be wearing body armor at the time and who also took out his ex - wife over a child support dispute .
nice .
i would n ' t be surprised if this arroyo character ( who was killed by police as he tried to flee ) had a serious criminal past but has been allowed to walk free due to our lax judicial process .
should this be a call for more gun control ?
absolutely not .
this case tells us two things : that concealed weapons permit holders respond faster than police because we are in greater numbers , and that criminals wear body armor too - so it ' s ridiculous to claim that we should outlaw guns that are " too powerful " for civilian use .
perhaps someone with a five - seven ( the gun the brady campaign calls the " cop - killer " and is trying to ban ) could have been more effective at stopping the armor - wearing gunner .

economic development accountability ?

2005 - 01 - 27 ##t ##10 : 17 : 00 the augusta free press ( motto : " our only agenda is the truth " ) has a chris graham story on a del . cha ##p peterson , d - fairfax , bill that would require pay ##back by companies lured to virginia by incentives if they do not stay for five years .
the text of h ##b ##28 ##9 ##8 is here .
peterson , of course , is a candidate for the lt . governor nomination . graham ' s article has the interesting hook of quoting one of peterson ' s rivals , former congress ##woman and state sen . leslie byrne , as app ##roving of the measure because it ' s " something that i ' ve been talking about for some time now . "
the virginia economic developers association has not taken a stance on the bill , but the organization ' s leadership is expected to meet tomorrow to discuss it .
demanding accountability from economic development is a rare phenomenon .
i would expect them to oppose it .
if anybody would like to debate the merits of this proposal or discuss economic development in general , the comment section is open .

by demanding accountability , peterson ' s bill is in the spirit of virginia ' s existing policy , thought perhaps somewhat tough ##er .

in my estimation , the bacon ' s rebellion blog is nothing more than " bacon bits " but do n ' t blog me wrong , because i love bacon bits on salad ##s .
the same might be said of cha ##p ' s con ##diment - packaged business bill .
delegate cha ##p petersen bill is nothing more than salt and pepper election ##eering in the 2005 statewide campaign - - and is probably tied into the democratic outs ##our ##cing cl ##amo ##r and growing threat of more manufacturing plants closing , which john kerry politically con ##tri ##ved and sensation ##ali ##zed for the 04 presidential run .
residents throughout the commonwealth of virginia and the rest of the nation are economically vulnerable due to free trade agreements and the global economy .
but both parties are responsible and have voted in favor of those agreements .
lt . governor candidate ' s cha ##p peterson and leslie byrne are both good politicians , but need to start thinking outside the box with legislation that will attract and benefit economic growth for the business world and create sustainable workplace ##s for virginia ##ns .
will , i agree with your analysis , the va business community along with a majority of ga members will probably deep - six this 5 - year mandatory requirement for compensation due to relocation .
if not bordering on the political rid ##or ##ku ##lous ( ridiculous ##ly do ##rky ) , it ' s just plain lu ##dic ##rous to believe business owners would agree to a capital investment with strings attached to the businesses health and longevity .
reward - to - punishment - to - reward maybe good dog training techniques , but it ' s not very business friendly .
the commonwealth needs legislation that requires a mandatory employee stock ownership plan ( es ##op ) within the contractual economic development agreements .
the es ##op is itself a corporate finance vehicle that provides monetary incentives with lending institutes , state and federal tax benefits , new capital investment , and most of all , the stock ownership plan increases va employee capital wealth .
more capital wealth will drive our consumer - base economy through the flipping roof .
but most importantly , how many virginia businesses will choose to relocate - - or outs ##our ##ce when employee are the corporate stock ##own ##ers ? and lets say the business has no other choice but to remove to the third world . . .
when virginia ' s employees are fully vested in company stock , they will also re ##ap from the profits of lower wages in the global marketplace just like the corporate big boys .
it ' s win - win - - sort of .

peterson is slightly to the right of byrne , but not by much . . .
frankly , i do n ' t consider tax and spend liberals as good politicians . unfortunately , the republican party is also loaded with its share of ir ##res ##pon ##sible big spend ##ers , but hopefully some of them will be held accountable during the 2005 primary elections .

del . dwight jones ( d - richmond ) , chair of the caucus , said killing the bill had been their " main objective " in an effort to , according to lazarus , " promote economic justice for black businesses .
"
i believe any neutral management consultant worth his or her salt would recommend a merger of the two organizations .
there is considerable du ##plication of effort and db ##a is strong in one area - - financial controls - - where d ##mbe has consistently had problems .
there would be service benefits to business clients , too .
nonetheless , the symbolism of having their " own " agency and support from governor warner for maintaining d ##mbe ' s " independence " apparently overcame any efficiency and service argument .
another article , this one by staff writer sk ##eet ##er fa ##ul ##k , describes sen . george allen ' s commitment to naming the new federal courthouse in downtown richmond for spot ##ts ##wood w . robinson iii , a noted naacp lawyer and federal judge .
robinson worked with th ##urg ##ood marshall on brown v . board of education .
fa ##ul ##k finds the nomination a " surprise " in light of allen ' s past , when he " embraced and g ##lor ##ified the confederate flag and its sy ##mp ##athi ##zers . " fa ##ul ##k chalk ##s the naming up to allen ' s presidential ambitions .
it ' s tough to be a republican when it comes to the african - american community .
do nothing and you confirm their worst suspicions ; do something and it ar ##ouse ##s a different kind of suspicion .

? ? ? ?
- ? ? - ? ? t ##17 : 26 : 00 will , i share your frustration at the reaction to allen ' s nod to spot ##ts ##wood robin ##s .
among some segments of the african - american community , it is indeed a matter of damned - if - you - do , damned - if - you - don ' t .
but you could say the same thing of the democratic party as a whole .
i think it ' s important to recognize that african americans , though still overwhelmingly democratic , comprise less of a mono ##lit ##h than they did 20 - 30 years ago .
i find myself continually amazed at how open - minded many young african - americans are .
and i think that open - minded ##ness goes a long way to explain the desperate efforts of many ( not all , but many ) within the democratic party to circle the wagons with the cry of " racism , racism , racism " when the evidence of racism is increasingly a stretch .
it ' s like how , after the civil war , republicans " waved the bloody shirt " , ass ##oc ##iating the democratic party with the secession and , ultimately , the war itself .
eventually , that tactic lost its power .
and so , too , will the cries of racism , racism .

after killing her , he dumped her body down the same ditch where he dumped the 17 - year - old girl he had previously been convicted of murdering .
tug ##le was on parole for this crime when he killed the grandmother .
i understand that representing people is what attorneys do but even attorneys have some choice in whom they represent .
the line of defense kai ##ne used was that tug ##le had not really raped the grandmother because " for ##cable so ##dom ##y was not rape according to the law at the time . "

some senators represent people pools that are in turn fractured into five or six house districts .

former governor gerald bali ##les , in this same vein , has advocated a real ##ignment of the two houses in a way that serves common ##ali ##ties .
he has suggested that we either increase membership in the senate to 50 , or decrease house membership to 80 , producing a scenario wherein 1 senator would represent a block of people who are represented by exactly 2 delegates .
he thinks - - and i think he is right - - that this arrangement would foster a closer working relationship between the senate and the house .

if true , these are serious charges , worthy of high - level investigation .
what ' s missing from the article , though , is any attempt at investigative journalism to give even one factual example supporting the inn ##uen ##do .
what ' s also missing is a fair - minded review of whether the sa ##gging numbers reported for swam procurement are valid .
someday a journalist is going to take the time to watch a sample number of swam firms submit bids on openly posted contracts , then use procurement tools that are in place to determine if any swam firms were unfair ##ly denied contracts they deserved .
until then , this carp ##ing appears to be sour grapes .

i ' ve decided to incorporate my old work blog into a general blog , the work diary is up on the right titled " my work diary " .
e ##ff yeah !
bush won !
ok then .
my next thought .
the world is a much better place now that the terrorist ya ##ssar ara ##fat is dead .
here is a good one minute video on his great legacy here .
this guy was one of the early inn ##ova ##tors of terrorism in this century and he is pro ##tray ##ed by the main stream media ( ms ##m for short ) as a " freedom fighter " .
because of him millions of palestinians chose " jihad " over peace with is ##real .
he inn ##ova ##ted suicide bombers and plane hi ##jack ##ing plus he em ##be ##zz ##elled hundreds of millions of dollars from aid funds . . . . and this guy got a nobel peace prize , what a disgrace .
update 1 - dr ##udge is reporting that ara ##fat has been ski ##mming 2 million a month from the gasoline trade in the territories
mag : ara ##fat skimmed $ 2 million a month from the gas trade sun nov 14 2004 09 : 53 : 40 et ##ne ##w york - - last year auditor ##s discovered ara ##fat was guilty of ski ##mming $ 2 million a month from the gasoline trade in the territories , time reports .
in august 2002 international donors forced ara ##fat to sign over his investments to the palestine investment fund , which was audit ##ed by u . s . accountants and managed by palestinian finance minister sal ##am fay ##yad , a former international monetary fund official .
after sc ##ouring corporations throughout the arab world and bank accounts in the cayman islands and luxembourg , the auditor ##s identified $ 800 million , which has been made a part of the palestinian authority ' s official budget .
it ' s the most successful financial reform in the arab world , - - jim prince , president of the los angeles - based democracy council and head of the audit team , tells time .
people close to fay ##yad ' s investigation told time of ara ##fat ' s ski ##mming from the gas trade .
breaking the gasoline smuggling and corruption boosted the palestinian authority ' s official treasury by $ 10 million a month and cut gas prices for ordinary palestinians . " ara ##fat ' s death means his followers may never know just how much more they may be owed , " writes time ' s matt rees in " where ' s ara ##fat ' s money ? "
in the mid - 1990s , ara ##fat controlled a financial empire worth at least $ 3 billion .
by the time of his death , he was down to his last $ 1 billion , according to israeli - intelligence estimates .
ara ##fat wife su ##ha ' s outburst that his successors were " trying to bury [ him ] alive " came after she learned that ara ##fat had signed over at least $ 800 million to the government of the palestinian authority two years ago , time reports .
top palestinian officials say su ##ha wants the new chief of the p . l . o . , mahmoud abbas , and palestinian prime minister ahmed qur ##ei to give her money out of the p . l . o . ' s party co ##ffer ##s .
but a senior p . l . o . official tells time , " they ' ll pay her a pension , and that ' s it .
" people familiar with ara ##fat ' s finances say the palestinian leader sent su ##ha $ 200 , 000 a month out of the palestinian authority ' s budget for the office of the president .
french authorities are investigating transfers of $ 15 million from swiss banks to paris accounts in su ##ha ' s name at the arab bank and at bn ##p par ##iba ##s bank , a french bank , time reports .
senior palestinian security officials tell time that ara ##fat also shipped money to the gunmen of the a ##q ##sa martyrs brigades .
developing . . . sure sounds like a nobel prize winner to me .

here are some of the fine achievements of the terrorist mar ##wan bar ##gh ##out ##i mar ##wan bar ##gh ##out ##i ( born june 6 , 1958 ) is a palestinian leader from the west bank and a leader of the fat ##ah movement that forms the backbone of the palestinian authority and the palestine liberation organization ( pl ##o ) .
on june 6 , 2004 , he was sentenced to five life sentences for five murders of israeli civilians and 40 years imprisonment for attempted murders in terrorist attacks against israeli civilians .
bar ##gh ##out ##i was one of the major leaders of the first int ##if ##ada in 1987 , leading palestinians in a mass uprising against israeli occupation of the west bank .
during the uprising , he was arrested by israel and deported to jordan , where he stayed for seven years until he was permitted to return under the terms of the oslo accord ##s in 1994 .
in 1996 , he was elected to the palestinian legislative council , in which he advocated peace with israel , sometimes coming in conflict with ya ##sser ara ##fat .
the formal position occupied by bar ##gh ##out ##i was the general secretary of fat ##ah in the west bank .
by the summer of 2000 , bar ##gh ##out ##i and ara ##fat had grown increasingly at odds with each other , with bar ##gh ##out ##i accusing ara ##fat ' s administration of corruption and his security services of human rights violations , and ara ##fat was planning to fire him shortly .
however , as the second int ##if ##ada began , bar ##gh ##out ##i became increasingly popular as a leader of the fat ##ah tan ##zi ##m militia .
this was perhaps due to the transformation of tan ##zi ##m into an organization more resembling militant groups like hamas and islamic jihad , responsible for dozens of civilian deaths in drive - by shooting ##s .
under bar ##gh ##out ##i , the tan ##zi ##m has also carried out suicide bombings in israel under the name al - a ##q ##sa martyrs ' brigades .
what is he thinking ?
release a known terrorist to run the pl ##o and that will bring about peace , give me a e ##ffin break

allies
curt
2004 - 12 - 28 ##t ##0 ##9 : 27 : 00 2 ##sl ##ick pointed me to a article at in iraq for 365 .
this is a great blog and i encourage you all to read it regularly .
on sunday he wrote of two iraqi soldiers who did n ' t see us as conqueror ##s but as allies when the mo ##sul bombing occurred .
the suicide bomb sprayed bb - like fragments throughout the mare ##z dining facility .
one piece of sh ##ra ##p ##nel sliced through the fe ##moral artery of a u . s . soldier and his only chance for survival was in the hands of these two iraqi ##s .
recalling the medical classes they ' d received from the special forces , the iraqi ##s reacted calmly , fast ##ening a belt above the wound , creating a tour ##ni ##quet , which stopped the gus ##hing stream of red .
they moved the soldier to a med ##vac vehicle via two - man litter carry .
after they hoisted the soldier in the truck , the two iraqi ##s - - one an officer , the other an nc ##o - - ran back to the facility and began treating the other wounded without regard for their safety .
when the dust settled and the mess tent had been evacuated , everybody who could talk was questioned about their health .
when the med ##ics came to the two iraqi ##s , the ing soldiers only wanted to know how everybody else was .
when asked why did they do it , they simply stated , " this was our duty ; we are a team , and we take care of each other . " even the americans .
no matter what the ms ##m tries to tell you , there are iraqi ' s who will help the allies , who will fight alongside them and put their lives at risk to make sure democracy succeeds in their country .
this brings to mind a speech prime minister tony blair gave recently while visiting iraq .
when i meet the people working alongside the united nations - - iraqi ##s in fear of their life every day , because they are trying to bring freedom and democracy to their people - - when i see their courage and their determination and know that they speak for the vast majority of people in iraq who want that democracy and freedom , then i know that we are doing the right thing . . . .
and i will also say this to you : there are people dying in iraq , but the reason people are dying is because of the terrorism and the intimidation and the people who are deliberately killing anyone trying to make this country better .
now what should our response be as an international community ?
our response should be to stand alongside the democrats - - the people who ' ve got the courage to see this thing through - - and help them see it through . i ' ve got no doubt at all that that is the right thing for us to do . . . .
sometimes when i see some of the reporting of what ' s happening in iraq in the rest of the world , i just feel that people should understand how precious what has been created here is .
and those people from that electoral commission that i described as the heroes of the new iraq - - every day . . .
a lot of them are n ' t living in the green zone , they ' ve got to travel in from outside .
they do not know at any point in time whether they ' re going to be subject to brutality or intimidation , even death , and yet they carry on doing it .
now what a magnificent example of the human spirit - - that ' s the side we should be on .

laser beam question
curt
2004 - 12 - 30 ##t ##18 : 44 : 00 this recent news story is tr ##ou ##bling in many different ways .
when i first heard of the story i figured it was some wa ##ck ##jo ##b playing with a new toy but now we find out there have been 7 incidents since christmas from the west to east coast .
the fbi , concerned that terrorists could use lasers as weapons , is investigating why laser beams were directed into the cockpit ##s of seven airplanes in flight since christmas .
laser beams can temporarily blind or di ##sor ##ient pilots and possibly cause a plane to crash .
the fbi is looking into two incidents in colorado springs , col ##o . , and one each in cleveland , washington , houston , te ##ter ##boro , n . j . , and med ##ford , ore . , according to federal and local law enforcement and transportation officials , some of whom spoke only on condition of an ##ony ##mity .
a federal law enforcement official , who declined to be identified by name , said thursday there is no evidence of a plot or terrorist activity .
but pilots are troubled by the incidents , and the fbi earlier this month warned of the possibility that terrorists might use the devices as weapons .
" it ' s not some kid , " said paul ran ##cat ##ore , a pilot who serves as deputy chairman of the security committee for the allied pilots association .
" it ' s too organized . "
loren thompson , who teaches military technology at georgetown university , called it a " rather wo ##rri ##some development , " though he said experts would be more puzzled than alarmed .
" what we ' re talking about is a fairly powerful visible light laser that has the ability to lock onto a fast - moving aircraft , " thompson said .
" that ' s not the sort of thing you pick up at a military surplus store . "
thompson said a piece of equipment that could do the things the fbi suspects would be " fairly expensive and fairly sophisticated .
"
" it sounds like an organized effort to cause airline accidents , " thompson said .
michelle mal ##kin has a post about this today where some outlets have stopped selling lasers .
lots of people think that these indeed might be lo ##oni ##es playing with new christmas toys but i disagree .
these are incidents where the airplanes were tracked , some as high as 850 ##0 feet .
to track a fast moving plane at that altitude would not be some toy you can get from the local wal - mart .
in my opinion this is quite alarm ##ing .
this is n ' t writing , it ' s typing has a great post out with a ton of info , some of it quite scary a more frightening scenario is that terrorists may have obtained a chinese - produced z ##m - 87 laser blind ##er which is specifically designed to blind eyes ##ight .
the japanese terrorist cult au ##m shin ##rik ##yo - - which launched the infamous sar ##in gas attack on the tokyo subway system in 1995 - - was discovered to have experimented with the use of lasers as weapons .
according to the asian pacific post , " cult members apparently obtained laser design information from russian institutes they visited and built a laser weapon mounted on a truck . they had planned to use the laser against tokyo policemen , but the plan failed when the laser mal ##fu ##nction ##ed during the testing stage . " political ##ex also has some info on this story also .
i found the following report that was presented to congress recently about the shoulder launched miss ##le threat to airline ##rs , which this might very well be a precursor to : recent events have focused attention on the threat that terrorists with shoulder fired surface - to - air missiles ( sam ##s ) , referred to as man - portable air defense systems ( man ##pad ##s ) , pose to commercial airline ##rs .
most believe that no single solution exists to effectively mit ##igate this threat .
instead , a menu of options may be considered , including installing infrared ( ir ) counter ##me ##as ##ures on aircraft ; modifying flight operations and air traffic control procedures ; improving airport and regional security ; and strengthening missile non - proliferation efforts .
e ##qui ##pping aircraft with missile counter ##me ##as ##ure systems can protect the aircraft even when operating in areas where ground - based security measures are unavailable or in ##fe ##asi ##ble to implement .
however , this option has a relatively high cost , between $ 1 million and $ 3 million per aircraft , and the time needed for implementation does not allow for immediate response to the existing terrorist threat .
procedural improvements such as specific flight crew training , altering air traffic procedures to minimize exposure to the threat , and improved security near airports may be less costly than counter ##me ##as ##ures and could more immediately help deter domestic terrorist attacks .
however , these techniques by themselves can not completely mit ##igate the risk of domestic attacks and would not protect u . s . airline ##rs flying to and from foreign airports .
legislation introduced in the 108 ##th congress ( h . r . 580 , s . 311 ) calls for the installation of missile defense systems in all turbo ##jet aircraft used in scheduled air carrier service .
while this legislation is still under consideration , homeland security appropriations designated $ 60 million in f ##y ##200 ##4 and $ 61 million in f ##y ##200 ##5 to fund a program to develop and test prototype missile counter ##me ##as ##ure systems for commercial aircraft based on existing military technology .
it is anticipated that at the conclusion of this program , in january 2006 , the department of homeland security will be able to provide a detailed analysis of the suit ##ability of such systems for use to protect commercial passenger aircraft .

europe changing their tune ?
curt
2005 - 01 - 01 ##t ##22 : 44 : 00 american future has a link up to a article written in yesterday ##s houston chronicle .
it describes how the european governments look to be changing their tune in regards to president bush .
why you ask ?
but there is arguably more to this sea change than just a gr ##ump ##y acceptance of the status quo .
from a european perspective , three things are making it easier to warm to the bush white house .
one is the death of ya ##sser ara ##fat .
no issue divides europe and the united states more keen ##ly than the israeli - palestinian dispute .
for the last few years , europeans have criticized bush for failing to put enough pressure on israel to get out of the occupied territories and for refusing to deal with ara ##fat .
that another reason why i respect bush so much , his refusal to acknowledge that wind ##bag terrorist ara ##fat .
may he rot in hell .
but since ara ##fat ' s death , europeans and americans have been able to find common ground : supporting ariel sharon ' s withdrawal from gaza , putting pressure on israel to let the palestinians hold elections and , covert ##ly , backing mahmoud abbas to become the next palestinian leader .
a second reason is europe ' s growing worries about islamic terrorism . the murder in november of theo van gogh , a provocative dutch filmmaker , at the hands of an islamic militant has been called europe ' s 9 / 11 . though the two events are obviously not fully comparable , it is certainly true that american conservatives , such as francis fu ##ku ##yama and bernard lewis , have found a wider audience recently for the idea that radical islam is in ##imi ##cal to european traditions of tolerance .
you mean those radical muslims can be kinda nasty sometimes ?
get outta here . . . .
keep doing business like the coward ##s in spain and they will more then likely have their very own 9 / 11 to cry about .
the third force is the re ##app ##ear ##ance , albeit in a mild ##er form , of the threat that kept the trans - atlantic alliance together for half a century .
the russian bear is growling again .
the ukrainian election - - - complete with its kgb - style poisoning of the opposition leader and heavy - handed electoral fraud - - has reminded european diplomats of vladimir v . putin ' s determination to control his " near abroad .
" they should be very worried about this item , i believe putin is slowly sliding russia back to what it once was . hopefully our government is n ' t asleep at the wheel with this situation either .
there is a personal edge to all this .
just as the s ##no ##ot ##y continental ##s eventually came to admire the go ##rm ##less hollywood actor , there is a gr ##ud ##ging willingness to re ##thi ##nk some prejudice ##s about the ina ##rti ##cula ##te tex ##an .
many european leaders once swallowed the michael moore version of history : that bush was an ignorant inter ##lo ##per who stole the white house . his thumping re - election , however , shows that he represents a large body of conservative american opinion .
in short , europeans are getting used to the idea that it is not bush who is the exception , but the u . s . itself that is exceptional - - - and that if they want to deal with this exceptional super ##power they need to humor it rather than ri ##le it .
strangely enough , this has been tony blair ' s strategy all along ; it is rapidly becoming the continent ' s strategy , too .
could n ' t of ended that article any better myself .
get used to it france , we ai n ' t going nowhere .

mis ##chi ##e in jail
nicola ##e mis ##chi ##e , authoritarian leader of a district organization of the main opposition party , has been jailed .
romania voted in the last december , ou ##sti ##ng the so - called socialist party ps ##d ( social - democratic party ) .
ps ##d managed to keep a stronghold in poor rural areas , with the help of people like mis ##chi ##e .
they combined blackmail , using their right of decision regarding the public funds for local leaders opposing ps ##d , and strong seduction of the une ##du ##cated masses , in a marvelous way .
e . g . , mis ##chi ##e , who talks like an idiot , got a phd in history .
his paper was on a political personality of the 19th century and mis ##chi ##e bought the house where his paper ' s subject lived .
maybe he tried to invest in his paper , maybe he believed sincerely in his admiration for the poor innocent dead guy and his ability of earning phd ##s , but using a big car and living in a big house are signs for the masses that the man is an in ##val ##ua ##ble and ir ##re ##pl ##ace ##able leader .
another misleading sign was his position as a university professor - he was teaching mostly at private universities , which are still ways to buy diploma ##s here in romania .
local leaders did their jobs , but national leaders , press ##uring tv stations to lie , ass ##oc ##iating with old communist ex - president ion il ##ies ##cu , failed to win in big cities .
ps ##d is building a strategy for the 4 years to come and they are going to elect a leader .
it is known that communist leaders die in office ( as judges of the u . s . supreme court ) and ion il ##ies ##cu wo n ' t be different .
all the leaders that expressed different points of view will be excluded from the party , that ' s the unto ##ld truth that romanian media seem to hide or not con ##ce ##ive yet .
mis ##chi ##e was right to critic ##ize the national leaders , because ps ##d got a good share in the elections in his area .
but mis ##chi ##e was wrong , because he did that while in vacation in switzerland , where you ca n ' t go if you earn 20 k $ a year .
the new power had nothing to do , but let the policemen do what they should be doing years ago .
il ##ies ##cu and nas ##tase , ex - president and ex - prime minister , are now left only with the leadership of the party and holding this ill ##uso ##ry authority .
if mis ##chi ##e would n ' t take his chance on them , he would still be free , with the help of the weak and weakening strings il ##ies ##cu might still pull .

fall ##uj ##ah ' s ' final solution ' ?
ze ##yad
2004 - 11 - 08 ##t ##19 : 42 : 06 the interim government declared a state of emergency in iraq excluding the kurdish region for 60 days , according to the national security law introduced last august which states that emergency laws can be declared in the country for a period no more than 60 days provided a serious threat against iraqi national security is recognised by the interim government .
obviously , this is a necessary step that should have been taken at least two months ago .
suicide bombings and guerrilla attacks carried out by insurgents and foreign terrorists based around baghdad have escalated to alarm ##ing levels particularly during rama ##dan .
deputy governor of di ##yala along with several council members from ba ' qu ##ba were ambushed and killed in la ##ti ##fi ##ya south of baghdad , an area which has supposedly been ' cleared ' from insurgents a couple of weeks ago .
four suicide attacks in sam ##ar ##ra , also a recently ' liberated ' area , against national guard units and the governorate building .
za ##r ##qa ##wi ' s group claimed responsibility for the attacks .
three police stations in had ##itha , a small town west of rama ##di , were assaulted by groups of insurgents .
some 30 policemen were captured , tied up and executed in cold blood against the walls following a confrontation which lasted two hours .
za ##r ##qa ##wi ' s group , again , claiming responsibility .
a full - scale military operation against fall ##uj ##ah , which is apparently underway already , seems to be the government ' s ' final solution ' .
i ' m not optimistic to the outcome , especially when significant civilian casualties are una ##vo ##ida ##ble .
note , that i ' m not suggesting a peaceful or political solution would work either in these areas .
insurgents west of baghdad have quite ob ##sti ##nate ##ly made it clear that nothing but full control of the country , or at least the an ##bar governorate , will satisfy them .
they have refused to participate in the political process , they have repeatedly announced their intentions to boycott the elections and to disrupt them in other areas , and they do not recognise the government or any other authority in the country beside themselves .
the demands of the fall ##uj ##ah ne ##go ##tian ##ts from the government weeks ago were obscene and they clearly reflect the over ##t sect ##arian ##ism and regional ##ism of the armed groups in the area .
the demands were not released to the iraqi public at the time for un ##kow ##n reasons but they have leaked out days ago .
here are just a few of them :
- a clear timetable for the withdrawal of foreign occupation forces ( fair enough ) .
- immediate withdrawal of us and iraqi security forces from the an ##bar governorate and the hand ##over of security responsibilities to former army officers from an ##bar .
- the appointment of ministers from the an ##bar governorate to the ministries of interior , defense , oil and finance .
- the removal of certain officials ( most of them from shi ' it ##e islamic parties such as ibrahim al - ja ' far ##i ) from governmental positions .
- the complete return of ba ' at ##his ##ts , army officers , republican guards , mu ##kha ##bara ##t , intelligence and security personnel to their former positions .
- the removal of shi ' it ##e ed ##han ( call for prayers ) from official television and radio programs .
- incomes of shi ' it ##e sacred shrines should be returned under the control of the ministry of endowment ##s and religious affairs .
these last two demands have been allegedly added by sheikh hari ##th al - dh ##ari ( head of the association of muslim scholars ) and are said to have been a major reason behind the failure of negotiations with the government .
iraqi ##s here in the south were shocked to hear of these demands and sect ##arian tensions are on the rise .
it scares me to see the reaction of people around me whenever fall ##uj ##ah is mentioned .
the director of a primary health care clinic was remark ##ing the other day that " fall ##uj ##ah should be burnt upon its residents and then ra ##zed to the ground .
they are the sons of mu ' aw ##iya , may allah curse them all . " side ##note : mu ' aw ##iya bin ab ##i su ##fy ##an was the governor of syria during the 7th century and he fought imam ali bin ab ##i tal ##ib ( mu ##ham ##med ' s son - in - law ) over the caliphate after the assassination of caliph ot ##hman .
he became the first umm ##ay ##id caliph and two decades later , under the caliphate of his son ya ##zi ##d , imam hussein bin ali ( grandson of mu ##ham ##med ) was killed by his armies at present day ka ##rba ##la .
someone hushed the director and pointed out to him that i ' m sunni .
he was a bit embarrassed and tried to explain that he was referring to wah ##hab ##is and foreign fighters .
it was a bit uncomfortable and i could feel that people were giving me fur ##tive glances .
refugees have been pouring out of fall ##uj ##ah over the last few days into baghdad and the surrounding areas .
the military operation will undo ##ub ##tly ag ##gra ##vate the humanitarian situation inside the city since there are definitely thousands of families with no place to go .
refugees in baghdad have confirmed the rumours that the ' mu ##jah ##ide ##en ' are forcing men from 15 - 50 years old to stay and that they were threatened with execution if they refuse to carry arms in defense of the town .
maj ##lis shu ##ra al - mu ##jah ##ide ##en ( the mu ##jah ##ide ##en advisory council ) are in control of fall ##uj ##ah and they have distributed a statement inviting arab and foreign ( including american ) media reporters to enter the town and cover the battles .
the statement carried the insignia of za ##r ##qa ##wi ' s group q ##a ' ida ##t al - jihad .
everyone is closely watching what the next few days will bring , hoping the violence does n ' t spread to the streets of baghdad or other areas .
i ' m still hole ##d up in bas ##rah but i ' ll try to be on the road as soon as possible .

daylight savings time is re ##tar ##ded
mark back ##er
2004 - 11 - 03 ##t ##13 : 00 : 00 i am 36 years old .
i ' ve been around a while .
i ' m not 87 or anything , but i ' ve seen some things in my life .
i have initially agreed and disagreed with different things over the years , only to have my mind changed later .
however , i will never ever change my mind about the id ##io ##cy we call daylight savings time .
i google ##d " daylight savings time " and i got the following link :
http : / / web ##ex ##hi ##bit ##s . org / daylight ##sa ##ving /
i started reading . . .
the site says things like " we ' ve learned to save energy and enjoy sunny summer evenings by switching our clocks an hour forward in the summer " and there ' s no s at the end of savings .
it should be daylight saving time .
my apologies to the ass ##cl ##own ##s that invented this id ##io ##cy and the goo ##bers that per ##pet ##uate it in such a ridiculous fashion .
i will con ##cede that " spring ##ing forward " and " falling back " are good ways to remember to change the batteries in your smoke detectors . however , new years and the fourth of july would do the same thing .
i kept reading the website of prop ##ogan ##da and found that the first person to come up with the idea was benjamin franklin who did it on behalf of some friends that owned oil companies ( oil was used in lamps ) .
i assume that , because the idea was dumb and inc ##on ##ven ##ient , lots of people ignored it . " by 1966 , some 100 million americans were observing ds ##t based on their own local laws and customs .
congress decided to step in to end the confusion and establish one pattern across the country . the uniform time act of 1966 ( 15 u . s . code section 260 ##a ) which was signed into public law 89 - 38 ##7 on 12 april 1966 , by president lyndon johnson , created daylight saving tim to begin on the last sunday of april and to end on the last sunday of october .
any state that wanted to be exempt from ds ##t could do so by passing a state law .
there ' s a lot more to this since then , and you can read a lot more it if you want to , but this is what i know :
indiana ' s eastern half does n ' t use it .
what ' s that all about ?
arizona does n ' t use it because one tribe of indians stretches into three states .
but those other states do use it .
hawaii does n ' t use it at all .
of course , they ' re closer to japan than to us , and since japan does n ' t use it , hawaii just plays along .
( do you think the hawaiian ' s sit around , staring west , just be ##cu ##ase they still do n ' t trust the ja ##ps ? )
regardless of when i go to bed ( 11 pm or 10 pm or 9 pm ) , i get up at 5 : 30 and i am fucking exhausted .
how can that be ?
i slept the same number of hours as i did two weeks ago , yet i ' m tired ?
also , i am so hungry i could eat my little tub of car ##me ##x by 10 : 30 ##am every day .
i used to eat lunch between 11 : 30 and noon , but now , eating is all i think about after 10 am .
why is that good for me ?
i do n ' t care if america saves 1 % of its energy consumption costs during those times .
i am tired , hungry , and i leave for work and get home from work in the dark .
how healthy is that ?
for that matter , i do n ' t care about any of the pro - farming or anti - crime prop ##ogan ##da .
daylight savings time sucks ! !
now , if you ' ll excuse me , i have to go stalk the lobby for the girls that are bringing me my k ##rys ##tal ##s .
order and fight to keep myself from falling asleep in my cube .

mark back ##er
2004 - 11 - 08 ##t ##15 : 07 : 00 it ' s auburn - georgia week , ladies and gentlemen .
after all the smack talk that ' s gone on for the last 360 days , and all of the games that both teams have played and the hopes each had for the 2004 season , it ' s come down to this .
to stay undefeated and alive for a chance at the bc ##s title game , auburn must win this saturday in it ' s 3 : 30 est game on cbs against the georgia bulldogs .
if they hope to move up from their current number five ranking and keep the hope alive of playing in the sec title game in december , georgia must beat auburn .
this game is as good as it gets .
sure , auburn ' s in - state rival is alabama , but year in and year out , this game , the auburn - u ##ga game , seems like the one that matters more .
i seldom if ever root for bam ##a , but i always root for u ##ga to be undefeated when the play auburn .
the game is big enough already , but it seems even bigger when one or both teams have something on the line .
yes , both teams have other games left to play and yes , other teams ' results may affect what happens to both of these teams , but in just five days , these two teams will play the biggest and most important game of their season .
so now it ' s time for all of the ya ##pping and jaw ##ing and talking shit that goes with this game .
except i do n ' t do that .
i ca n ' t do that .
anytime i try to talk shit , i get all na ##use ##ous and worry about what happens not if but when we lose . i do n ' t know if it ' s just me or if being this pr ##ag ##matic is what it means to be an auburn fan .
i wonder if deep down this is what it feels like to be a red sox fan : regardless of where you are or what is happening to your team , deep down you do n ' t just think , you know something bad is going to happen .
anyway , i am flying my flag on my house with pride and i am looking forward to the game that , year in and year out , gives us the best hitting and mo ##s entertaining football played on the highest level .
it ' s sec football at it ' s core .
war eagle .

auburn ' s last defeat came at the hands of . . . u ##ga .
blur ##ble . . .
auburn does lead the overall record in the series 51 - 46 - 8 .
however , the road team ' s record in this series .
at auburn , u ##ga is 11 - 8 - 2 .
at athens , auburn is 17 - 8 .
this trend was serious in the 80 ' s , with the road team winning about two - thirds of the time .
the only time this changed recently really was when u ##ga decided to win in their place in 2003 .
thanks da ##wg ##s .
blur ##ble . . .
on the upside , auburn has scored at least 33 points in the last six games .
that ' s a pretty nice run .
auburn leads the sec in scoring offense , scoring defense and rushing defense .
auburn is second in the nation in scoring defense and seventh in pass defense .
jason campbell is 3rd in the nation in passing efficiency while david greene is 10th .
here are a couple of middle of the road stats :
auburn ' s quentin groves and georgia ' s david poll ##ack are tied for the sec sack lead .
here ' s the biggest for what it ' s worth stat as far as i am concerned : both teams are undefeated this year when scoring first .
auburn is 8 - 0 and u ##ga is 5 - 0 .
i ' d say that ' s the biggest stat right now .
auburn ' s offense is potent and efficient .
u ##ga ' s defense is relentless and contains a couple of the country ' s biggest hitter ##s , especially greg blue and ode ##ll th ##ur ##man .
auburn ' s defense is fast and relentless and the db ' s are experienced and big .
u ##ga ' s receivers are leaders , with one of them a team captain .
auburn ' s two running backs are seniors and very experienced and dangerous , br ##uising backs .
u ##ga ' s two backs are smaller freshmen with less experience , but are dangerous as well .
in my mind , the game is going to turn on a few key points , some obvious and some not .
here goes the prediction machine :
- turnover ##s ( as always ) will be critical .
- special teams play and lack of special teams mistakes will tell the tale regarding field position .
- both teams must establish the run to be successful .
if auburn goes for 150 between their two backs , they ' re almost impossible to beat . conversely , georgia must be able to run the ball to set up play action and keep the pressure off of david greene .
- mark rich ##t has proven to be a better on the fly adjustment coach that tommy tube ##r ##ville .
tub ##s is famous for taking chances , often unnecessary ones .
that history is of concern to me .
while it ' s okay to try crazy shit when your team is under - rated or a serious under ##dog , it ' s important not to give games away when you ' re the favorite .
playing more " by the book " and a bit " closer to the vest " becomes the call for the day .
considering all of these factors , i truly believe that this is auburn ' s year .
they may not go undefeated and they may not get into the bc ##s title game , but they have enough talent , po ##ise and experience to win this game .
auburn wins 31 - 21 .
and now that i have typed that prediction , i may just throw up in my mouth .
war . . . blur ##ble . . . eagle ! !

2004 - 11 - 17 ##t ##0 ##7 : 23 : 00
putting the cart before the horse . . .
mark back ##er
2004 - 11 - 17 ##t ##0 ##7 : 23 : 00 you know , for the past five days and really for about the past fifteen or twenty days , i ' ve been angry about the bc ##s rankings and why auburn is n ' t ranked higher and all of that business .
can someone tell me why one of my friends or family members has n ' t smacked me because of it ?
i mean , here we are , 10 - 0 and staring down the barrel ##l of a road game at tu ##sca ##lo ##osa against our hated rivals , the alabama crimson tide , and i ' m bitch ##ing about how we better get to play for a national title ? really ?
you do n ' t have to think back too far to find a similar scenario , only with the shoe firmly on the other foot .
in 1989 , alabama was 10 - 0 , number two in the nation and coming into auburn for the first time ever to play at jordan - hare stadium .
all the talk for the weeks leading up to the game was about " if bam ##a ' s undefeated , they ' ll play for it all in the sugar bowl " and other crap like that .
well , " if or when " never happened because auburn won 30 - 20 in one of the greatest iron bowl games ever , putting an end to bam ##a ' s national title hopes for the year .
15 years later , the situation ' s reversed .
it ' s auburn that ' s undefeated and facing the road game at the end of the season .
suddenly , i ' m about na ##use ##ous about this game too .
despite being riddle ##d with injuries , alabama has a ridiculous ##ly stout defense , recently ranked as the number one defense in the country .
e ##ga ##d .
has all of the blu ##ster and talking shown up on the plains as well ?
i only hope that coach tube ##r ##ville has been successful at keeping his players focused , motivated and thinking about only the alabama game .

do people never learn from the mistakes of others ?
mark back ##er
2004 - 11 - 17 ##t ##11 : 07 : 00 for those of you not from around these parts , linda sc ##hre ##nko was the state of georgia ' s super ##int ##end ##ant of schools .
it seems that in recent years , instead of doing the people ' s business , good ole linda has spent her time stealing over 600 grand in federal education funds .
she used it for various things , but the favorite is the nine grand she spent on a face ##lift .
here ' s a link to the story :
link
one thing that made me laugh is that she showed up at her indictment in a fur coat .
umm ##m , am i the only one that learned anything from the michael ir ##vin drug trial of the mid 90 ' s ?
you never ever show up at court , especially facing indictment for stealing large sums of money , wearing a fucking fur coat ! !
fake or not , you look like you ' re rubbing the common man ' s nose in it .
sc ##hre ##nko is a sc ##umb ##ag and , although she wo n ' t get any actual jail time , i hope the fine she plead ##s to is at least as much as what she stole .
otherwise , she ' s learned nothing .
remember when michael milk ##en got busted , he was not forced to give up his secret accounts , and when the fine of 600 million was levi ##ed . . . he paid it ! !
hell , at his zenith , that ' s what he made in one year ! !
" um . . . how much , your honor ?
600 large ?
yeah , le ##mme just get my check ##book out of my diamond en ##cr ##ust ##ed briefcase . "
sc ##hre ##nko stole 20 times what martha stewart did , and i bet she wo n ' t see the wrong side of a jail cell door , and that ' s sad .
because it ' s people like sc ##hre ##nko for which jail ##s were specifically designed . . .

1 day to glory . . .
mark back ##er
2004 - 11 - 19 ##t ##10 : 02 : 00 well , it ' s mid - morning on the east coast and i am sitting here running numbers thru my head trying to figure out what ' s going to happen in the iron bowl , which is just over 29 hours away .
the game is being played in tu ##sca ##lo ##osa , which should be an advantage to alabama .
however , in the two times the game has been played in bryant denny stadium , auburn has won .
alabama has one of the sting ##iest defenses in the country , and were ranked number one in overall defense as recently as last week . conversely , auburn has one of the most potent and balanced offensive attacks in the nation .
also , i do n ' t think bam ##a has faced an attack with two great runners , a great line , a poised qb and good receivers and a tight end as well .
bam ##a is missing it ' s starting offensive back ##field from the start of the season .
the fact that they ' ve won six games is a testament to the coaching and heart of the players .
alabama simply can not throw the football , which is a good thing , because auburn ' s defensive back ##field is second to none .
bam ##a can run the ball however .
unfortunately for them , with no passing game to keep the defense honest , auburn will probably stack nine in the box , play man on the corners , and dare bam ##a to run , and i do n ' t think they ' ll be able to do it .
auburn is also 9 - 0 when they score first .
the tube ##r ##ville way is to get one quick and early to get your crowd into it if you ' re at home and to quiet the other team ' s crowd if you ' re on the road .
you can never tell what is going to happen in rivalry games .
in this exact game 15 years ago , bam ##a came into auburn # 2 in the country , undefeated at 10 - 0 and looking for yet another national championship . they were sum ##mar ##ily tr ##oun ##ced 30 - 20 in a game in which the score was closer than the actual game .
that could very well happen saturday .
i always tell people that the georgia game matters more to me than the bam ##a game .
i live in georgia , and losing that game affects me much more directly than losing the alabama game .
that said , when kickoff time comes , you remember all the reasons that you hate alabama and their dumb ##ass hair ##cut ##s and their deter ##gent and toilet paper and their hounds ##tooth hats and their " bear this " and " bear that , " and everything else that goes along with it .
this is n ' t a football game , and it ' s not two drunken cousins fighting at a family reunion .
this is brother against brother after one slept with the other ' s wife and then bragg ##ed about it .
it ' s that serious .
however , when it ' s all said and done , i just do n ' t think alabama has the horses to stand up to what i believe is going to be enormous defensive pressure .
if auburn takes care of the ball and execute ##s , this game should n ' t be as close as some think .
my call :
auburn 37
alabama 13
now pass the tu ##ms .
i do n ' t feel so well . . .
war eagle ! !

there ' s not " holiday " in this holiday weekend . . .
mark back ##er
2004 - 11 - 28 ##t ##16 : 41 : 00 we have been on the go since about noon on wednesday and even longer in the wife ' s case .
she started cleaning about a week before the holiday and cleaned for about two weeks right thru the holiday .
we spent friday doing a little shopping and got to bed early , but saturday was busy with football watching .
the irish suck .
not as a people , but as a football team .
the looked good for 15 minutes , but then they got run over by matt lei ##ner ##t and usc .
i have no beef with usc being number one , but oklahoma is nowhere close to number two in the country , and i am sick of the polls ##ters who only look at east coast scores instead of watching tape of the games .
auburn has trailed in exactly two games this year , and has given up less than 9 . 5 points per game . oklahoma has given up bucket ##load ##s of points , but still gets some mystery respect for it .
( i know many of you may be tired of my ran ##ts about this , have no fear .
it ' ll all be over by next sunday night or monday morning .
at that point , we ' re either in or fucked and either way , i ' m writing about it once then , and that will be it ) .
anyway , we decided to go ahead and get a fake tree yesterday , and we got that bad boy put up yesterday and are decor ##ating it today .
we also got all of our exterior lights up today , marking the first time this family has ever had their decor ##ating done by thanksgiving sunday .
big ku ##dos to the miss ##us .
it feels weird not watching racing today , but it ' ll get easier and then , come january 10th or so , there ' ll be testing news and driver signing news and we ' ll be on the back side of the remaining 84 days until the daytona 500 .
until tomorrow kids , war eagle ! !

somebody alert the media ! ! !
mark back ##er
2004 - 12 - 02 ##t ##0 ##7 : 11 : 00 apparently jason gia ##mb ##i , recently the non - playing and " sick " first baseman of the new york yankees , admitted to a grand jury that he " injected ana ##bolic ste ##roids and human growth hormone ( h ##gh ) as recently as 2003 .
and he apparently got them thru bal ##co and ( surprise ) the same guy that is barry bonds ' trainer , once greg anderson .
since that grand jury testimony was given , gia ##mb ##i repeatedly denied using any ste ##roids , h ##gh , or anything else to anyone and everyone that would listen .
jason ' s brother jeremy also admitted to the grand jury that he used ste ##roids .
now , barry is denying he ' s done any ste ##roids and gary sheffield ' s denying he ' s done any ste ##roids , but one by one , the lesser ( and bigger ) players in this deal are seeing their testimony coming into the the public eye where they admitted that they did do ste ##roids .
it seems that anyone associated with this special " trainer " greg anderson is coming up dirty .
it ' s a good thing that major league baseball has such a tough ste ##roid policy , or this story may not have been brought to our attention . ( cough . . . cough . . . sarcasm . . . cough ) .
never mind if the ste ##roids and human growth hormones were illegal in baseball or not .
they are illegal to use in the united states .
i want to know where the federal criminal charges against all parties involved are .
anyone ?
the fact that these guys ( she ##ff , the gia ##mb ##is , marion jones , bonds and many others ) are running around denying this shit and acting like pete rose did any time someone asked him about gambling ( getting uber defensive , denying it implicit ##ly and acting like the person asking had personally assaulted him ) is app ##all ##ing .
these clown ##s are messing with people ' s careers by insisting they ' re being lied about , yet when it turns out the reporters were n ' t lying and the athletes were , nothing is done .
i have never denied that barry bonds was a special and gifted athlete .
whether it ' s ste ##roids , h ##gh , crank , lighter fluid or anti ##free ##ze he ' s using , being able to perform at this level for this length of time def ##ies logic or reason .
that ' s why it ' s a shame that , in the final analysis , all of bonds ' numbers and accomplishments are going to be ignored and lump ##ed into the statement " yeah , but he was on ste ##roids . " it ' s a pity he and the others are too dumb to see that .
and now , just so you do n ' t think that every entry in this blog will be like the one above , here ' s a great joke i read today :
a man takes his rot ##t ##weiler to the vet and says , " my dog ' s cross - eyed , is there anything you can do for him ? "
" well , " says the vet , " let ' s have a look at him . "
so he picks the dog up and examines his eyes , then checks his teeth .
finally , the vet says " i ' m going to have to put him down . "
" what ?
because he ' s cross - eyed ? "
" no , because he ' s really heavy . "
i will be breaking down the sec championship game either later today or tomorrow , so i expect you all to be planted firmly on the edge of your seats waiting for that one .
war eagle everybody !

hey , look who got screwed . . .
mark back ##er
2004 - 12 - 06 ##t ##0 ##7 : 33 : 00 i am having a difficult time putting my feelings into words right now , so bear with me .
first of all , i want to cong ##rat ##ulate the auburn football team for doing what no other auburn football team has done ; going 12 - 0 .
they also won their first outright sec title since 1987 and won their first sec title since the conference imp ##lim ##ented the championship game format .
a year ago , the program was in di ##sar ##ray and the coach was one poorly executed plane trip away from being fired by an over - ze ##alo ##us and too empowered booster with a fat check ##book .
since that day , the team is undefeated and has won 14 games in a row .
they have now beat ##ed four teams that were in the top 15 at the time the games were played , and two of those games were won away from jordan - hare stadium .
on championship weekend , the big three all played .
usc won by five over a shitty ucla team with a 6 - 5 record , and that was thanks in part to an official who blew dead a clear and obvious fumble that would have been returned for a ucla touchdown .
oklahoma played in it ' s conference title game against a four - loss colorado team that ca n ' t throw the ball .
the result was a 40 plus point beat ##down , but what did anyone expect ?
auburn played 15th ranked tennessee and was attempting to do one of the tough ##est things to do in college football : beating a team twice in the same year .
with the exception of a 15 yard shan ##ked punt and a punt snap that ko ##dy bliss missed while having an apparent th ##rom ##bos ##is , auburn led 21 - 7 at the half and had held ut to 46 yards of offense .
while the auburn running game was held up , jason campbell threw it all over the ball field and , when his receivers were covered , he ran for yard ##age on his own .
this despite several late hits to the head , low hits at his knees and ankles , and various other assaults outside the realm of good sportsman ##ship .
tennessee scored on a pass play that was incorrectly ruled a touchdown , since the ball clearly touched the turf , and that ' s where the momentum of the game changed .
i think it was also at that point that the score ##board began to reflect auburn ' s last title hopes dying as the oklahoma - colorado score would have begun showing the beat - down that was occur ##ing .
auburn was tied 21 - 21 and in je ##ap ##ord ##y of losing it most important game ever , but senior qb jason campbell would have none of it .
auburn won going away 38 - 28 , and the only place the game looked close was on the score ##board .
i ca n ' t believe that an undefeated sec team is not playing for a title , but i guess we can thank jeff saga ##rin and the other dick ##s that keep voting usc number one to make up for what happened to them last year .
all i know is that they better think that way next year , because it ' s auburn that got screwed this year .
and what ' s better is that auburn gets to play one of the three hottest teams in the country in my opinion .
virginia tech is talented , very athletic and one of the most well coached teams in the country and they will come to play on january 3rd .
i hope our kids can shake off this tr ##aves ##ty and focus on making the polls ##ters look like idiots .
maybe an oklahoma win in a butt - ugly game and a great auburn performance could help .
what ' s the definition of pr ##ag ##matic ?
going undefeated and chanting " we ' re number two ! ! "

so get this . . .
mark back ##er
2004 - 12 - 16 ##t ##0 ##6 : 56 : 00 i ' m reading espn this morning when i stumbled across the story where kobe bryant said he ' d like to sit down with sha ##q and apologize to him for " involving him in my troubles . " bryant also says that he thinks december 25th " sounds like a good day to me to kind of talk to him and tell him i never meant in any kind of way to bring any of his personal business out . "
you see , after kobe ' s world fell apart because he could n ' t resist banging the crazy white towel clerk at his hotel , he needed an out .
he bought his wife a four million dollar ring and got some tattoos that said how much he loved her , but he needed to do more to attract attention away from himself .
so he told the media that he should have done what sha ##q always did , just pay the women to shut up .
kobe also alleged that o ' neal had paid upwards of one million dollars in this way as hush money over the years .
sha ##q has denied it from the beginning , but that ' s not really the point .
it ' s no secret that a large number of the nba ' s " stars " are not exactly star - worthy .
good players or not , guys like kemp and bryant and iv ##erson and the entire blazers team are just not very nice or good people .
if the league will tolerate it , what do i care ?
but the real issue is this .
kobe ' s lakers will play sha ##q ' s miami heat on . . . that ' s right . . . december 25th .
so the real motivation for kobe here is not to men ##d fences or admit he was wrong to involve any other person in his own little pit of wo ##e . it is to find some sort of way to keep the 340 - pound sha ##quil ##le and his teammates from beating the ever - loving shit out of kobe for 48 pain - filled minutes on christmas day .
i ca n ' t tell you the number of ways that kobe bryant makes me sick . despite his slick talk and his nice di ##ction , he ' s nothing but a cheat ##er and a liar and a punk .
i hardly watch any nba games because the league and most of it ' s players sick ##en me , but i ' ve had december 25th circled on my calendar since the day after sha ##q signed with the heat .
that ' s the day that sha ##q will take a million dollars or more out of kobe ' s punk - ass .

it ai n ' t much . . .
mark back ##er
2004 - 12 - 17 ##t ##16 : 39 : 00 sorry i have n ' t been posting much lately .
we have been so damned busy with the holidays ( that ' s what we call december at our house ) that i just have n ' t had time .
i read a funny joke today and i thought i ' d share it with you .
one of my fellow egg ##ers posted it , so chet , here ' s your credit :
a traveler was driving through arkansas when he lost his way and got off the main highway .
as he drove by , he saw rows and rows of pigs ##ties and pig ##pen ##s and pigs running in fields and pigs wall ##owing in mud . suddenly , his eye caught something really strange .
he did a double take , muttered to himself and then looked a third time .
he wondered if he had seen correctly - it looked like a pig with a wooden leg !
he found the lane to the farm and drove up into the farm ##yard , where he was met by the farmer . " excuse me , " the traveler said .
" i was just driving by and looking at all your pigs , and i noticed something that i just had to stop and ask about .
tell me , did i see right ?
is there really a pig out there with a wooden leg ? " the farmer smiled . " oh , that would be old caesar you saw .
he ' s the finest pig a man could ever hope to have - and smart !
well , let me tell you a little about that pig .
you see that barge down there on the river ?
that ' s a mining dr ##edge , taking out platinum ore .
old caesar sniffed out the vein and showed us how to set it up .
now that dr ##edge brings me in about $ 120 , 000 every year .
" there ' s another thing , too , a little more personal .
one night a couple of years ago i got to drinking and i guess i had more than i should have .
i passed out drunk , fell down and knocked over a lamp .
that started a fire in the house and old caesar smelled the smoke .
he came in the back door , got the wife and kid out , rouse ##d me up and got me out .
" there is no question about it - that night old caesar saved all our lives and you know that is not the sort of thing a man is going to forget too easily .
" " why , " the traveler said , " this is all amazing !
i have never heard of a pig like this before !
this is fantastic !
but tell me , how did he get that wooden leg ?
was he in a wreck or something ? " the farmer laughed and said , " well , naturally , when you have a pig that smart , you do n ' t want to eat him all at one time ! "

2004 - 12 - 20 ##t ##0 ##9 : 19 : 00
did anyone see the packers game sunday ?
mark back ##er
2004 - 12 - 20 ##t ##0 ##9 : 19 : 00 while it was entertaining , that ' s not why i ' m posting about it .
i do n ' t normally post about pro football , but what i saw deserved a ran ##ting or two , and i suspect it ' s going to get many more in the days and weeks to come .
with 4 : 41 left in the fourth quarter and the packers down by 11 , fa ##vre hit robert ferguson with a 31 yard strike near the left hash marks .
coming from the other direction , jacksonville db don ##ov ##in darius un ##loaded chin high on ferguson with a vicious clothes ##line .
remarkably , ferguson held on to the ball , despite being di ##s ##jo ##ined from his helmet on the hit .
after many minutes lying motionless on the field , ferguson was finally removed via stretch ##er , giving a thumbs up to the crowd on the way out .
the packers went on to lose the game , but that ' s not the story here .
this was not one of the staged stiff - armed clothes ##lines you see in professional wrestling broadcasts .
this was a vicious , arm cocked and swinging clothes ##line that literally could have torn ferguson ' s head off of his body .
the play was immediately flag ##ged , and moments later it was announced that darius had been ejected , much to the crowd ' s delight .
one side ##note here is that , despite their ra ##bid fan ##dom and the situation , not one thing was thrown at the off ##ending player as he left the field .
it would have been easy to bath ##e him in beer or snow ##balls or batteries as he left , but the pack ##er fans are class ##ier than that .
to a person , they acted with class , using their voices and not projectile ##s to express their displeasure .
this was the most vicious and b ##lat ##antly dirty play i have seen in the nfl since jim mcmahon was body slammed to the ground in the mid 80 ' s about five seconds after he had released a pass .
and jaguars coach jack del rio and darius had the nerve to vo ##ci ##fer ##ously argue with officials about darius ' e ##ject ##ion from the game .
i do n ' t care what anyone says about " you ca n ' t judge intent .
" darius ' intent was to di ##sm ##em ##ber , in ##jure or even kill ferguson .
the more i saw the replay , the sick ##er it made me feel .
the league must take action , and it must be swift and sure .
i ' m talking about a four game suspension that included the playoffs if necessary .
in this day and age of bigger , stronger and faster players , injuries are going to happen accidentally all of the time .
there is simply no room for the kind of play that resulted in ferguson ' s injury .
paul tag ##lia ##bu ##e must give word to all of his employees that actions like this will not be tolerated .
maybe that will tell the jaguars , darius and players like him that this kind of head - hunting will not be tolerated in the nfl .
if not , i fully expect the packers and many other teams to handle this matter " on the field " with darius being the target of similar attacks by tight ends and offensive lineman .

thanks for everything babe .
now , the thing i forgot to tell you was that when i walked out of the office to go home on the 23rd , there was a pink post it on my car .
it said :

i am happy she left the note and took responsibility for it , but what in the fuck is going on that every couple of months i ' m taking cars to the shop for things that are not my fault ?
this is the third incident in 15 months , and two of the three involved other folks hitting my parked cars ! !
i knew my 20 year clean record would end sometime , but do the karma gods have to beat me over the head with a shovel about it ?
so today i had enterprise pick me up at 7 : 15 , which was great .
i was worried about being late to work and , as it turned out , i was only 16 minutes late .
i was given a choice between a tau ##rus and an imp ##ala .
i took the imp ##ala .
i made the wrong choice .
it drives like shit .
so much for my gm loyalty .

we ' re number 2 ! ! ! !
mark back ##er
2005 - 01 - 05 ##t ##15 : 26 : 00 the college football season is finally over .
on one hand , i am a bit sad because years like this only happen for auburn every 15 or 20 years , so it ' s a little disappointing .
on the other hand , this worked out about as well as it could .
if you asked me at the beginning of the year if i ' d rather be 8 - 3 and playing in the liberty bowl or 12 - 0 with a chance to win the sugar bowl , go 13 - 0 and finish second , i ' d say hell yeah to the latter .
the fact that pun ##dit ##s put ou ahead of auburn based on their out of conference schedule being tough ##er than ours is laugh ##able now .
in the end , playing bowling green over us playing the citadel did n ' t make the sooner ##s much better .
man , i ' ve seen softer take ##down ##s on cops .
usc came on to the field , gave up a td , then decided to make choke - la ##hom ##a their collective bitch ##es , and they did just that .
38 - 10 at the half meant that i did n ' t even have to hear that dying h ##yen ##a ash ##lee " no , i ' m the one with dark hair and no boo ##bs " simpson butcher yet another song on tv .
hell , i read it on far ##k this morning . ho ##ora ##y for big first half beating ##s that get me an extra hour of sleep .
we might not have won , but we would n ' t have let lei ##ner ##t go long on us all night either .
our db ' s would have had something to say about that . and , it turns out that when playing a decent team , ou ca n ' t do shit on offense .
that was just plain terrible .
jason white looked like jason vo ##or ##hee ##s out there , st ##omp ##ing around getting caught from every direction any time he did n ' t hand of to peterson for a three yard loss .
in five years , oklahoma has played in four huge games , and lost three of them . . . badly .
that must feel like being a sox fan before this year , i ' d imagine .
anyway , i feel great .
think about this .
a year ago , tube ##r ##ville was one reporter ' s ab ##ili ##lty to find an out of place airplane in ohio away from being fired before the alabama game .
then , the ad and president get canned , a booster starts down the long road to shu ##n - ville , and tube ##r ##ville keeps smiling and saying the right things .
he talks his two running backs and two stellar db ' s into staying , then knocks out 15 straight wins and signs one of those super iron - clad contracts that will pay him 14 million over seven years , and if auburn even thinks . . . thinks about letting him go , they owe him every penny .
i do n ' t even think there ' s a morality clause .
he could have sex with an endangered bald eagle , and they ' d still have to pay him .
and that ' s the way it should be .
meanwhile , auburn fans can spend the next six months saying " yeah , but we ' d have done this " or " we were 13 - 0 , won the sec , beat five top ten teams , three of them on the road , and became the only undefeated sec team in the bc ##s ' s history to not play for the title . " and coincidentally , oklahoma ' s played in it this year , last year , and in 2000 .
you won in 2000 , but you got punk ##ed the last two years , and last year you got to play for the title even though you did n ' t even win your conference .
you got em ##bara ##ssed by kansas state and lsu last year , and humiliated this year .
but the little 12 is soo ##o much better than the sec .
that ' s why you played a four - loss team for your conference title this year .
and , considering the bc ##s is run by the head of the big 12 , it ' s no wonder you get the benefit of the doubt .
do n ' t think so ?
how about the fact that only two teams that did n ' t win their conference have ever played for the national title ?
you and nebraska in 2001 .
oh , the other thing you two big 12 teams have in common is that you got your ass ##es kicked on the sport ' s biggest stage .
so yes , we are disappointed .
but all you can do is play the schedule in front of you .
auburn did that with class and dignity , they won every game , faced down every challenge , and made every auburn fan in the country and the world proud .
war eagle ! !
now , can someone get the auburn cheer ##leader ##s some of those usc sweater ##s ?
me ##ow !

who saw this coming ?
mark back ##er
2005 - 01 - 05 ##t ##16 : 32 : 00 much like the " i told you so ' s " everyone is throwing at the u ##ga basketball program after their hiring and subsequent firing of the ha ##rrick ##s , folks around the buck ##eye state have to be having similar thoughts .
it seems that ad and frequent " no we did n ' t " ohio state front man andy ge ##iger is " retiring " after 11 years at the helm .
maybe it ' s me , but i ' m guessing andy ' s tired of putting on tv makeup and going on the news lying about what he or tres ##sel knew about their athletes in general and their football program in particular .
it seems that maurice cl ##ar ##ret ##t - gate just is n ' t going away .
two years ago , everyone was saying " shame on you , maurice .
you should have known better . " now , it seems like most folks are saying " shame on you both andy and jim .
you both should have know better . "
allegations have come to light that several os ##u players received illegal benefits including cash , access to cars , etc .
now , i do n ' t expect the ad and coach to know everything , but when a player is driving a brand new car every couple of weeks or months , well , somebody ought to jo ##t a memo and get to the bottom of that .
it should n ' t surprise buck ##eye fans either , since tres ##sel had similar problems at young ##stown state , and left a wake of controversy behind himself there as well , including ( surprise ) illegal benefits including cash , cars , grade fixing , etc .
ge ##iger is also tired from saying " we did n ' t do anything wrong " about his basketball program .
of course , it was discovered that his men ' s basketball coach had directly given six grand to a yugoslavia ##n recruit , but that was just his st ##ipe ##nd for travel and coach jim o ' brien was just having a problem with the currency exchange rates . . . right andy ?
i only hope that the ncaa will do something they rarely do : make a good sound decision and take away ohio state ' s national title from january 2003 .
it seems they had a very important and very ineligible player that season , and maybe many .
i ' d hate to give another title to thug ##town miami , but i ' d give it to alabama before i ' d think it was okay for ohio state to keep .

mark back ##er
2005 - 02 - 17 ##t ##0 ##6 : 47 : 00 would it make a noise and if it did , would anyone south of boston give a shit ?
wednesday , commissioner gary bet ##tman announced the cancellation of the 2004 - 2005 nhl season .
as if everyone did n ' t already know that was the case .
shame on the nhl and shame on the players ' association for not getting a deal done , but i put much more of the blame on the owners as this " negotiation " came down to the wire .
i understand that the league was losing less money by not playing than it would have by having a season this year .
i also understand that when push came to shove , the players gave in and accepted a salary cap . okay , the sides were about 7 million per team apart , but could n ' t they just say " alright , let ' s split that in half and play hockey ? "
i mean holy christ people , two kids arguing over 10 bucks would work it out that way .
why is this any different ?
the nhl ' s primary goal was to get a salary cap approved by the players , and they finally did .
and what did the nhl do when that moment ##us event occurred ?
they left the negotiating table .
gary bet ##tman is a mind ##less troll and the professional sports commissioner equivalent of joe hazel ##wood and this lock ##out / strike / cluster fuck is the reef .
the first thing that needs to happen is that bet ##tman and good ##eno ##w ( the players ' association rep ) need to be fired , deported , fl ##og ##ged , tar ##red and feather ##ed and finally forced to pay for four tickets plus a program , four dogs , four beers , and two coke ##s and parking to a game at an nhl arena for every day of the next season so they understand what the fans go thru to see a hockey game .
then , all current contracts need to be void ##ed by the end of the season in 2006 .
that means no team would own any player , and the owners would be free to sign whom ##ever they ' d like using the " fiscal restraint " they all drone ##d on and on about all year .
that way , they ' d only pay as much as they could afford . . . right ?
wrong .
those do ##uche ##bags would end up overs ##pen ##ding like every professional sports owner because they ca n ' t control themselves .
if mr . i ##gin ##la or heat ##ley were free agents , for example , owners would bid each other out of their minds , then they ' d be left with not enough to get a compete ##tive team .
while the business model in the nhl was certainly flawed and the owners needed help , they really needed help to protect them from themselves .
and the fact is that without that help , the owners would follow the same path that got them where they are right now anyway .
the biggest issue is this , however .
very few people give one hot shit whether the nhl plays another game ever , let alone this season or the next one .
for every crying can ##uck there are 1 , 000 or more others who say " no hockey ?
huh . . . didn ' t even notice . "
and the last television network interested in carrying hockey ( espn ) may opt out of tel ##ev ##ising the nhl next season , meaning that all of the teams would be in huge trouble , because no tv = no league .
period . atlanta lost the flames 25 years ago because , despite full houses every night , it ' s tv revenue that pays the freight and the flames had no tv contract .
imagine an entire league with no tv contract .
hell , major league soccer and the wnba do have a tv contract and no one gives a shit about them .
i ' ll say this for the nhl , when they screw up , they screw up huge .
cong ##rat ##s guys .
you will forever be known as the generation that killed professional hockey in north america .
that ' ll look great on your resume ##s .

the company ' s performance was n ' t all that hot even before the ceo went to prison , and until very recently the stock price reflected that . but this is a one - person company , and at this point it ' s saying the ' martha ' brand is worth some $ 1 . 31 billion .
if anything , the value of the brand should decline over time , ina ##sm ##uch as she ' s rather , well , mortal .
and she ' s been con ##vin ##cted of obstruction of justice .
this run ##up is based on the in ##ex ##pl ##ica ##ble hope that now that the head of the firm and the em ##bo ##diment of a much - resented brand is no longer doing time for lying to the federal government , they ' ll be able to really coin some money .

video rental ##s : the three h ##yp ##oth ##eses
byrne
2004 - 12 - 11 ##t ##18 : 45 : 00 scrap ##py under ##dog netflix had its day earlier in the year , when it became one of the hottest stocks around ( sporting an eye - popping p / e in the high 900 ' s on the way up , and , thanks to a poor earnings report , over 1 , 000 on the way down ) .
there ' s plenty of argument about the future of dvd and video rental , and netflix represents a pure - play on one of the three dominant h ##yp ##oth ##eses :
i . that business is o - v - e - r - - between pay - per - view , video - on - demand , pirate ##d movies , high - bandwidth internet broadcasts , and the increasing availability of other media , it takes some faith to see any future for movie rental ##s .
those who do n ' t have the re ##quisite faith will point to these factors as proof that the business is dying and the movie business in general will need a pretty significant overhaul before it can make profits .
movie rental ##s are no longer a cheap alternative to other ways of viewing films ; they ' re the st ##od ##gy , expensive way .
there are n ' t any pure - play buys on this theory , but someone who believes it might over ##weight their portfolio in cable companies - - if they purchased any media stocks at all .
of course , there have been companies whose performance would perfectly mimic the validity of this idea , but ps ##ue ##do . com failed without producing a single show , and broadcast . com was swallowed for $ 6 billion by yahoo ! , to yahoo ! ' s great regret .
ii .
not so fast - - it ' ll just go online ! - - anyone who wants to counter that argument would probably start by taking us back to 1997 , when in terms of time used , text was the most popular kind of information online .
at the time , and for years after , people argued that the traditional bookstore would become obsolete .
after all , how could we stand for a rap ##acious ##ly arbor ##ci ##dal medium like ' books ' or ' newspapers ' when we could transmit the same data as bits and bytes and save on transportation , too ?
as it turns out , of course , amazon . com , barns ##ean ##d ##nob ##le . com , and a host of others simply took the bookstore model , attached a 56 k mode ##m , and declared themselves the future .
netflix is doing much the same thing : taking the traditional business online to cut costs and boost customer service .
iii .
who d ' you think you ' re kidding ?
you ca n ' t kill movie rental stores - - so there ' s a big difference between movies and books : for books , the retail store is practically the sole medium of distribution ; if you do n ' t sell through them , books wo n ' t get sold .
for movies , the video rental store is just one way to get videos out there ( though at 45 - 55 % of studio revenues , it ' s a much more important one than people think ) .
but given the high valuation ##s ascribed to bricks - and - mortar - and - dead tree books ##eller ##s like barnes and noble , borders , and to a much lesser extent books - a - million , surely there ' s room for a blockbuster , along with a movie gallery or two .
the latter , at least , still has room to grow .
by focusing on smaller , rural communities ( prefer ##ably the sort that considers ds ##l ' new ##fan ##gled ' ) they ' re wal ##mart ##ing wal ##mart - - competing with wal ##mart ' s awful in - store video rental ##s by offering better selection and much lower prices .
the movie business is changing dramatically as the potential for online distribution grows , but like every other business it leaves lots of room for traditional operators to operate at traditional ( read : high ) profits .
the aggressive bidding war for hollywood video , featuring two of their competitors , a buy ##out shop , and one of the sa ##v ##vies ##t raiders around , is proof that some people still think these stores are worth something .
and i ' m one of them .
full disclosure : for once , i ' m actually writing about something i own : i have shares of movie gallery , i ' ve suggested it to friends , and i ' d be quite thrilled if the stock went up .
i do n ' t do ' sell targets ' , but i ' d probably hold the stock if it ran up anything less than 50 % from this level .
if i sell , i ' ll post a notification one trading day beforehand .
because lord knows you care .

wal ##mart : cong ##lom ##era ##ting ?
byrne
2004 - 12 - 12 ##t ##14 : 47 : 00 conglomerate ##s are a fascinating species : the standard definition is ' a company involved in multiple unrelated businesses ' but the more accurate definition would be ' a company that relies on financial p ##yr ##ote ##ch ##nic ##s , balance sheet jug ##gling , and ad ##roi ##t accounting to create the illusion of growth ' .
i love to write about them , but i ' d hate to own one , since most of their market value comes from the market ' s assumption that the company ' s leaders will somehow find a way to retro ##active ##ly justify their over ##val ##uation .
usually , it does n ' t work , but when it does the results can be spectacular ##ly entertaining .
for a while ( see ling - te ##mc ##o - vo ##ught or ty ##co for details ) .
the recent rumors about wal ##mart ' s plans to buy out a shipping company have given rise to the fear that the company may go the conglomerate route .
they have many of the symptoms of a late - stage conglomerate : a gigantic main business with slowing growth , fear that competition will substantially reduce the profit ##ability of their main business , a shareholder base that includes many people who own only wal ##mart stock ( thus providing another incentive for intra ##com ##pan ##y divers ##ification ) , and enough resources to pull it off on a grand scale .
i can understand the concerns , but i do n ' t see the motivation .
as a retailer of just about everything , wal ##mart can expand into some pretty broadly - defined areas without going beyond either their core compete ##ncies or some arenas where they can cut costs .
after all , adding some international shipping assets to their holdings would be a natural extension of their enormous ##ly successful practice of buying the distribution network for their products .
they ' re coming close to smith ##field food ' s very successful ' sq ##ue ##al to meal ' policy ; if these rumors are true , the result for shareholders will be a pretty positive one .

the final price , $ 26 . 50 per share , beats all the previous bids by a huge margin - - of course , oracle low ##ball ##ed their earlier offers , and ended up basically bidding against themselves and the optimism of other peoples ##oft shareholders for a year and a half .
it ' s been a pretty gr ##uel ##ing fight ( was it worth it ?
how much of peoples ##oft ' s most valuable - - human - - resources will walk out the door the day their options vest ? ) made all the more so by the widely - held assumption that larry ellison was either bluff ##ing or screwing around .
so it ' s over .
i do n ' t have oracle / peoples ##oft ' s spat to kick around anymore .
i ' ll have to stick with condemning the merger as a totally un ##work ##able deal between two sides who absolutely hate each other .
and i wo n ' t dwell on the irony of an oracle employee being driven out of oracle , starting his own company , and forcing ellison to spend $ 10 . 3 billion to get his company - - but not him - - back ( though it does rather delightful ##ly remind me of coca - cola basically giving away the bot ##tling franchise and then spending billions to buy it back ) .
ellison is brilliant enough to make this merger work , but he ' s crazy enough to wreck even the sound ##est of deals .

2004 - 12 - 15 ##t ##21 : 28 : 00 back in the day ( 2000 - 2003 or so ) some of the hottest non - home ##building stocks were the gaming equipment manufacturers , who rode a wave of heavy rein ##ves ##tment in casinos to produce huge profits . now , all that rein ##ves ##tment has paid off , and , along with a good dose of consolidation , made the industry moderately hot again .
like every boom , whether merit ##ed or not , the big companies have big moves in the early stage , but it does n ' t get attention or turn into a mania until we see a fr ##ene ##tic ip ##o or two .
you know where this is going : las vegas sands kicked off its first trading day with a 60 % gain after a last - minute increase in offering price to $ 29 a share , outside the $ 24 - $ 26 range band ##ied about after they dropped their first $ 20 - $ 22 estimate .
but , well , the business is complicated and the business is tough .
wynn resorts , another owner of the lucrative macau license that captured investors ' s attention during the ip ##o , illustrates this well enough : steve wynn , the company ' s founder , made a gigantic fortune when he bet his company ' s future on atlantic city .
when investors saw his $ 160 million all - debt investment turn into a $ 440 million asset in just a few years - - his net worth took a similar , though even less gravitational ##ly - bound arc , rising from $ 2 million to $ 75 million du ##ri ##gn the same time ) they all rushed in .
needles ##s to say , wynn sold when everyone else bought , and he made it through the can ##ni ##bal ##izing near - collapse those casinos faced in the early 90 ' s .
so , applause and cheers all around to the casinos raising such spectacular sums for your broad - scope ##d ambitions .
and a premature apology to the newly - mint ##ed shareholders , who will doubt ##less see some eye - popping returns in the right direction for a little while and then face a long road back to the reality that is a price around half the current one .
full disclosure , just for the hell of it : i was bear ##ish about the google ip ##o , too .
thank god i did n ' t sell short

well , sort of . it turns out the anonymous company , bai ##kal ##fin ##ans ##group , shares an address with o ##oo tv ##ern ##eft ##ema ##sh , which was recently bought by za ##o ga ##z ##pro ##mg ##eo ##com ##ser ##vic ##e , not to ever be confused by the similarly - named ga ##z ##pro ##m ( which by the way has a similar logo ) .
ga ##z ##pro ##m , of course , is the gigantic , k ##rem ##lin - supported gas company most observers assumed would bid for the assets .
there are n ' t many groups in russia who can afford a $ 9 . 3 billion bet , particularly when it ' s such a politically - weighted one .
ga ##z ##pro ##m may have arranged some last - minute debt financing , or might have an outside partner , but i seriously doubt they were n ' t in some way involved with the company that won the auction .

vi ##ox ##x : slightly bigger deal than we thought ?
byrne
2005 - 01 - 26 ##t ##0 ##7 : 11 : 00 mer ##ck posted a 21 % decline in earnings thanks to the new post - vi ##ox ##x announcement .
most of the profit decline was because vi ##ox ##x , representing about 11 % of sales , now represents a pretty severe legal headache : not only have they lost the revenue , but they ' ve taken a $ 600 million charge as a reserve against future vi ##ox ##x losses .
if that ' s an accurate number , investors should cheer up : mer ##ck ' s at fifteen times annual ##ized earnings , twelve times forward earnings , and under ##app ##re ##cia ##ted by most of wall street .
full disclosure : i own mer ##ck .
i bought the day of the vi ##ox ##x announcement .
and if i want to stay that contra ##rian , i ' ll have to sell only when i get an inside tip that they ' ve cured cancer , aids , heart disease , and death .

china : we could always ignore them , right ?
byrne
2005 - 01 - 27 ##t ##0 ##7 : 16 : 00 one of the rules of thumb that has guided my ( limited ) business career from the beginning is that china is never as lucrative as it looks .
this assumption is based on about 150 years of economic history , including several boom ##s in interest and investment in china .
their biggest problem : there ' s usually a 200 - to - 1 ratio of nearly starving peasant laborers to absurd ##ly well - off government employees .
and now it ' s an if ##fi ##er 100 - to - 1 , since there are also rich private sector employees and the labor force is n ' t quite so ex ##pen ##dable .
what they ' ve been missing for years was the real driver behind any consumer economy : consumers . specifically , they did n ' t have a real middle class .
that ' s changed in the last twenty years , as increasing social mobility and a burst in foreign demand has finally made china a genuine , rather than theoretical , contender .
and they ' ve even supplied proof of their economic via ##bility , announcing that they ' ve beaten japan for exports to the us .
if only i ' d figured this out in early 2002 , when their stock market was by some stretch of the imagination cheap .

off the hook ?
give us a break !
byrne
2005 - 02 - 01 ##t ##0 ##7 : 48 : 00 georgia ' s insurance commissioner , john ox ##end ##ine , claims that marsh ' got off the hook ' - - and you can bet he ' s got a plan to fix that . perhaps the worst feature of spit ##zer ' s at ##tila the hu ##n - like sweep through the financial services industry is his habit of breeding im ##ita ##tors , who will essentially use his settlement as a bench ##mark for creating their own demands .
interesting ##ly enough , this morning ' s wall street journal reported that marsh paid a higher fee than they needed to - - that the $ 850 million number was agreed upon at the last minute mainly so marsh could pay out over a four - year period without admitting guilt .
the rhetoric we ' re hearing - - that marsh may have cost customers billions of dollars - - does n ' t match the reality that in a few cases , they manipulated bids , but that the proven damages thus far involve only a few million dollars of business priced 5 % or 10 % higher than it otherwise would have been .
crazy .
full disclosure : i own shares of marsh , and i would not be particularly di ##ssa ##point ##ed if eliot spit ##zer ' s career took a sudden nosed ##ive thanks to , say , questions about his business relationship to money manager and alleged stock mani ##pu ##lat ##or jim cramer .

the exponential ##s
byrne
2005 - 02 - 04 ##t ##13 : 22 : 00 it ' s always difficult to get used to a central fact of the modern economy : the best new technology will keep getting better at an absolutely as ##tou ##nding rate .
usually , the improvement curve flat ##tens pretty fast - - the usual auto industry / computer industry comparison works just fine ( according to the standard urban legend , bill gates notes that " if we ' d been making cars instead of software , you ' d get 500 miles to the gallon , need an oil change every 250 , 000 miles , and be able to replace your car for $ 200 , " to which a mythical gm executive replies " ah , but if microsoft made cars , they ' d crash three times a day , too ! " ) .
anyway , a few announcements during the last two days under ##sco ##re the fact that the growth in memory and processing power for computers is far from over : he ##wl ##ett - packard is developing a new replacement for the trans ##isto ##r , and a consortium of software companies is backing a new technology that would allow discs to hold up to a ter ##aby ##te of information .
no idea where this will end up : it ' s not altogether rare that these announcements result in a very expensive project to develop something that , for whatever reason , is n ' t worth ##while to consumers .
but it ' s important to remember that the status quo is never more than a snaps ##hot - - investing as though it ' s permanent is a recipe for disaster .

the " twin deficit ##s " myth
byrne
2005 - 02 - 04 ##t ##13 : 37 : 00 according to the usually reliable cnn / money , the " twin deficit ##s " will continue to grow .
interesting terminology . . . i believe they ' re referring to the budget deficit and . . . the capital surplus ?
when analyzing trade deficit ##s , it ' s important to realize that the amount by which imports exceed exports is also equal to the net amount foreign investors have bet on the us .
so the trade deficit is due to a confluence of the pressures from us consumers ( who control about 20 % of global gdp ) and everybody else ( excluding the non - consumption share of us gdp , that would amount to around 75 % of global gdp ) .
which of those is - - probably - - going to be a more important number ?
even if we are consumers bent on go ##rg ##ing ourselves with imported goods , the largest pressure on the deficit is that we ' re simply a better place for investment - - higher returns on capital in developing countries are more than mit ##igate ##d by the higher political risks they face .
and what about that other deficit ?
it , of course , is the ominous sum that we fund without taxes , but by borrowing funds .
and about half of those borrowing ##s end up with the major banks in asia .
so , not to be a here ##tic , but 1 ) we ' re issuing them at relatively low interest rates , 2 ) inflation is bound to pick up eventually , and so 3 ) would n ' t you rather have our deficit ##s made up by economically non ##sen ##sic ##al purchases by non - us investors , rather than raising taxes in america ?
it ' s a question of who will pay for the same spending , and all else being equal i ' d be happy for asian central banks to pick up the tab .
the twin deficit ##s are a reality , but they are n ' t exactly a terrifying one .

turns out my initial attitude was n ' t justified , of course , and gma ##il has been a popular success .
just this weekend , google gave many users another fifty invitations , prompting some to spec ##ulate that it could be the start of gma ##il ' s final move out of beta .
their marketing was absolutely brilliant : simply through association with google , and because of the invitation - only membership , they created a product with instant cache ##t - - something so in demand invitations went for $ 50 on e ##bay , and one enter ##pr ##ising site even offered a kidney for an invite .
and now ?
everyone who wants a gma ##il account has one , and yet people with invites have an almost path ##ological desire to give them away .
it ' s been nearly a year , the service is nearly ubiquitous , and somehow google has kept us obsessed with gma ##il .

north ##shore management update
byrne
2005 - 02 - 16 ##t ##21 : 20 : 00 north ##shore management , the hedge fund firm accused of stealing millions of dollars in client funds , is now facing actual sec action . the amount in question : $ 37 million .
while it ' s not a major sum compared to the amounts consider before ( as high as $ 90 million ) , it ' s good to see that the issue ' s getting resolved .
though , of course , there ' s always the chance that these fund managers were stupid and shorts ##ight ##ed , not actually criminal ; apparently , the money stolen was lent to or invested in companies the managers controlled - - so they ' re guilty of front - running , at the least .
but they might have been using north ##shore as an alternative source of capital : having invested all they could risk , it would only make sense to turn to other sources .
what we ' ll need to look for in the coming weeks are 1 ) what happened to the money once it was invested in these companies ( were they real companies , or just avenues for stolen funds ? ) and 2 ) how much of this was disclosed beforehand .

choice ##point ' s biggest screw ##up
byrne
2005 - 02 - 26 ##t ##13 : 07 : 00 we all know by now that choice ##point allowed some highly respectable nigerian businessmen of imp ##ec ##cable credentials to view hundreds of thousands of customer records for entirely legitimate purposes - - they were paying customers , after all , and the customer is always right .
but even after that huge mistake - - or rather , because of it - - the company ' s top executives began dumping shares like mad .
what ' s scary is that since they started selling , the stock ' s down about 5 % .
clearly , they were expecting lots more damage .
these insider sales were certainly stupid , and probably criminal ( though the legal proof may be hard to come by ) but the solution is easy enough : they need to buy stock from the company itself , at some premium to the prices at which they sold - - they ' ll have the same stake as before , the shareholders would have gotten their money back ( since the premium goes to the company , which is owned by the shareholders ) , and there ' s no need to disrupt their business by taking the matter to court .
or , if you want to do things the sec ' s way , you could 1 ) hire a bunch of lawyers with the company ' s ( shareholders ' ) money , 2 ) hire a legion of pr firms to explain away that fr ##ivo ##lous spending , 3 ) hire a new accountant to magical ##ly turn that spending into an investment amor ##ti ##za ##ble over twenty years , and 4 ) settle out - of - court by having the ex ##ec ##s give the sec some pitt ##ance ( for which they ' ll likely be compensated by the company ) and a statement that " we neither admit nor deny that we did what you claim , but we ' ll never do it again . " thank god for the sec - - they ' ve practically made it a shareholder ' s utopia , here .

southern states considering higher cigarette taxes ?
byrne
2005 - 02 - 26 ##t ##14 : 44 : 00 good plan ; cigarettes impose pretty high penalties on states , ina ##sm ##uch as the states are caretaker ##s for plenty of people who are ill thanks to cigarettes .
what ' s notable in this debate , however , is that according to ms ##n money ##cent ##ral , tobacco executives are attacking the tax by noting that " while north carolina ' s ex ##cise tax is only 5 cents , the total taxes given to north carolina by smoke ##rs adds up to more than 61 cents per pack . " okay , okay - - since the tobacco companies pay lots of money to the states , that ' s technically accurate .
but the point of these taxes is to align the price of a pack with the cost to society , and ina ##sm ##uch as these penalties are n ' t assessed on a per - pack basis , they do n ' t - - they ' re a lump - sum reflection of the taxes these companies ought to have paid before .
interesting ##ly , the policy of making cigarette buyers pay to compensate society for the costs they impose is a politically pal ##atable synthesis of the un ##pala ##table notion of simply refusing treatment unless they pay full cost .
they ' re basically buying future medical care throughout their lives , rather than eventually making the ( healthy ) remainder of the populace pay up .
in short : good plan .

who will lead the revolution ?
would you believe mba ##s ?
john a
2004 - 12 - 24 ##t ##10 : 07 : 00 for my holiday post , i offer a message of hope for the business world .
in 1994 , i was a graduate student in boston .
i was asked to moderate a panel discussion on social entrepreneurship for a conference at harvard business school .
the conference was being held by a new group called students for responsible business .
i expected to see a small gathering of ideal ##istic , slightly naive mba students .
what i found was a packed room of 200 intelligent , practical , driven ideal ##ists .
these students were determined to figure out how to use business as a driver for positive social change .
i left that room with my eyes open to the possibilities presented by these future business leaders .
fast forward 10 years .
students for responsible business is now called net impact .
in 2004 , i had the opportunity to attend their conference hosted by the university of texas mcc ##om ##bs business school . net impact had grown to include over 9 , 000 mba students and alumni . approximately 900 people attended the 2004 conference .
the buzz words flying around the conference included social entrepreneurship , sustainable profit ##ability , working with passion .
i met student after student intent on harness ##ing the forces of business and capitalism to improve the world .
these students understand that business is a powerful lever of change in this world .
recently business schools have received their share of criticism for turning out graduates who seem to have lost sight of their responsibility for ethical action .
i can tell you that i am seeing a powerful grounds ##well of change coming from within business schools .
it is not coming from the faculty , or the alumni , or the administration . all these groups continue to pay lips ##er ##vic ##e to topics of social responsibility while avoiding any real innovations in the student experiences .
the change is being demanded by the students .
a little secret of business schools is that mba students have an immense amount of sway .
few choose to use it , but if they want they can fundamentally change their school .
right now students at business schools are asking for more discussion of these topics in classes , are initiating service projects , forming support group for social entrepreneurs , inviting speakers to campus to discuss sustainability , social investing , non - profit innovations , etc .
net impact is often at the center of these efforts .
these are not isolated events . . . this is a revolution from within .
i have no doubt that in 10 years we will see the vast positive impact that these students are having in the world of business and society at large .
in 1776 adam smith spoke of en ##light ##ened self - interest in the wealth of nations .
i often feel that we have convenient ##ly forgotten his emphasis on en ##light ##ened which he defined as being committed to being a good citizen and steward of society .
i am excited and hopeful that this new generation of business leaders will bring this emphasis front and center .
if you are an mba student and want a good reference for comparing how mba programs integrate issues of sustainability and social responsibility into the student experience a good place to start is the beyond grey pins ##trip ##es report produced by the aspen institute .
happy holidays to everyone ! !

it ' s good to be the king !
john a
2005 - 01 - 03 ##t ##0 ##9 : 44 : 00 here ' s an entertaining little morse ##l from business week online ( no by ##line given ) :
but on the subject of succession , those two look like role models compared with insurance giant american international group inc . ( ai ##g ) , whose aging ceo has no plans to retire .
maurice r . " hank " greenberg , who turns 80 in may , groom ##ed two sons to be successors , but both have since left ai ##g . greenberg sr . then created an office of the chairman in 2002 , which includes co - co ##os martin j . sullivan and donald p . kan ##ak .
both are considered possible successors , but the board wo n ' t know greenberg ' s preference until his departure , when it opens a sealed letter .
perhaps this is a good time for a quick ref ##resh ##er . . . .
the ceo works for the board . . . end lesson .
i guess it is not as straight forward when your ceo is also chairman and one of the largest shareholders .
it would be tempting to get on my high horse right now about the need to separate the positions of ceo and chairman but to be honest with you i do n ' t really believe that .
i know ceo / chair dual ##ity is a popular cause for corporate governance .
however there is little empirical evidence to suggest that separating these roles affects firm performance in either a positive or negative way . having a combined ceo / chairman does reduce the ability of the board to act as a check on management and this does mean that you need to be more critical in your assessment of the trust ##worth ##iness of the top management team .
this downs ##ide of having a combined ceo / chair is offset by ( 1 ) a reduction of coordination and communication costs at the top of the organization and ( 2 ) an increase in the negotiating position of the ceo when dealing with suppliers , potential merger partners , etc .
# 2 could be particularly useful in a dynamic industry .
i do however look more carefully at the top management team of a company with a ceo / chair before investing .
it is important that you can get a sense of the trust ##worth ##iness of the ceo .
is there high turnover among senior managers ?
is there a record of regulatory problems ?
if the ceo is new , i also look at the performance of the ceo ' s previous company .
i am most concerned if the fortunes of the prior employer took a sudden turn for the worse after the ceo left .

this site has a very easy to use search function and it might be worth the time to run a quick check on companies of interest to you as possible investments .
researchers affiliated with the clearing ##house just released an interesting report about securities class action trends during 2004 .

shareholders benefit from employer reputation
john a
2005 - 01 - 08 ##t ##13 : 23 : 00 it is just about time for fortune magazine to release its 2005 list of 100 best companies to work for .
so now is a good time to ask a simple question : why should we care ?
making this list is certainly a source of pride .
it can also be helpful if you are looking for a nice new job .
should anyone else pay attention to this list ?
well , thanks for asking because i just happen to have an answer for that question .
it turns out that investors can benefit by paying attention to this list as well .
in a study published in the journal of business finance & amp ; accounting ( 2003 , 30 : 77 ##1 - 79 ##8 ) , greg fi ##lb ##eck and dia ##nna pre ##ece found that companies on the fortune list of 100 best companies to work for out ##per ##formed a matched sample of firms along multiple measures of return .
this study is particularly relevant for investors because the authors measured return after the list was announced .
to often these studies use as a starting point the moment before information becomes public .
the only way to benefit from such information is by holding the stock before the information becomes public .
this study indicates that the best companies to work for information may still be useful even after the information becomes public .
it might also be useful to look at companies that have consistently made the list in the previous few years and make an educated guess about their inclusion on this year ' s list .
search the news archives and see if in the past year the company did anything that might have totally pissed off their employees .
massive lay ##offs , bitter union battles , stopped offering free massage ##s , etc .
you might also want to be wary if the ceo or a bunch of other top executives have been replaced .
that can often generate a period of uncertainty in a workforce .

it ' s hard to complain about cheap air ##fare ##s but . .
john a
2005 - 01 - 09 ##t ##19 : 47 : 00 i ca n ' t for the life of me figure out why anyone would invest in the airline industry .
please , someone tell me a group companies facing more serious problems than the legacy airline carriers ( delta , us airways , continental , american , northwestern , united ) .
high fuel costs , insane pension obligations , and a highly paid , specialized workforce .
to this list of wo ##es , we add a whole sl ##ew of competitors with much lower cost structures .
i admit i ' ve already taken advantage of the lower fares announced last week to book a business trip but these next few years are not going to be pretty for some of these companies .
unfortunately , the pain is not limited to these companies .
pittsburgh , one of us air ##way ' s hub ##s , built up its airport complete with a sprawling retail complex in the terminal . now us airways has reduced flights out of pittsburgh by 28 % since january of 2004 and is in real danger of folding completely .
these shiny new airports are usually financed by long - term bonds that still have to paid off . . . but not by the airlines .
this is an industry looking for a sustainable strategy .
southwest and jet ##bl ##ue were the only major airlines to earn a profit in 2004 but who knows what will be happening in another five years .
so i will thankfully accept the low fares , be ##mo ##an the loss of food on flights , and watch these companies parade in and out of bankruptcy .
business ##week online has some other commentary about the fare cuts here and about us air ##way ' s wo ##es here .

better late than ne . . . aw ##w forget it !
john a
2005 - 01 - 10 ##t ##10 : 09 : 00 remember how you stress every year to get those # % ^ ^ $ % # tax forms filed on time ?
just imagine how norte ##l feels .
early on tuesday norte ##l will be filing its 2003 financial statements .
it also expects to rest ##ate 2001 and 2002 earnings .
none of this is really new information . so the worst is behind them right ?
maybe .
late filing of audit ##ed financial statements and earning rest ##ate ##ments both factor into my external reporting organizational indicator .
as a rule , i am wary of companies that do either of these things until i am confident that they have changed their standard business practices .
it may take a couple years , and several more financial filing ##s ( on time of course ) , before i am persuaded to take a second look at the company .
the bottom line is that i rely on sec filing ##s to assess companies and i do n ' t want to have any doubt about the vera ##city of the information contained in these documents .
in norte ##l ' s defense , they have just gone through the perfect storm in the telecommunications equipment sector .
the whole industry over ##bu ##il ##t and got blinds ##ided by the tech down ##turn .
this could be described as a growth industry that went on a bender and is now trying to recover from the hang ##over .
i ' ve always felt that you learn a lot about someone when you see how they try to recover from a hang ##over ( pause for brief college flashback ) .
this is a great time to assess organizational effectiveness in the telecommunications equipment industry .
norte ##l and luce ##nt attempted to hide the damage ( what do you mean ?
i ' m not drunk ! ) and hope for an up ##tick in demand before they would have to come clean .
both companies have been penal ##ized for these actions and have continued to rest ##ru ##cture operations , sell assets , and lay ##off employees .
cisco , on the other hand , was able to take one huge restructuring charge in 2001 and move forward .
their ability to do this and have it work ( so far ) indicates a very deep and impressive understanding of their organization .
especially when compared to its competitors , cisco seems to be back in fighting form due to it ' s ability to rapidly assess its organizational structure and rec ##on ##fi ##gur ##e to meet the changing market . not bad for a company with a hang ##over !

2005 - 02 - 03 ##t ##21 : 02 : 00 socially responsible investing .
corporate social responsibility .
just saying these words seems to eli ##cit some fairly sim ##pl ##istic knee - jerk reactions .
the reaction that i find most amusing is the knowing look of sympathy .
you know , the one that says " poor naive soul .
if only you understood economics , you would understand the folly of your ways .
" i do not intend to get into the stake ##holder vs stock ##holder debate here or argue the relative merits of atlas shrugged .
those discussions , though interesting , avoid a simpler question .
do measures of corporate social responsibility contain valuable added information that help investors pick winning investments ?
if all that you have read about this topic is an article in business week or the wall street journal , you ' ve probably heard the standard answer - - the evidence is mixed .
that is true but not very revealing would n ' t you say ?
evidence is mixed mostly because ( 1 ) there is little agreement about how to measure social responsibility and ( 2 ) many current measures toss together a heap of information that has no business being lump ##ed together .
social responsibility often includes everything from treatment of employees to type of product produced . there is not really any reason to believe that selling guns or tobacco has anything to do with forcing employees to work unpaid overtime .
yet both get lump ##ed together in the socially responsible investing discussion .
once you start to break apart social responsibility into its various components , you start to see the valuable information .
companies that have poor employee relations tend to under ##per ##form , as do companies that poll ##ute at a higher rate than their industry peers .
on the other hand , companies with numerous nl ##rb violations do n ' t do worse than their peers and companies that sell your typical " sin " products ( tobacco , firearms , gambling ) can be excellent investments .
lump all these things together and of course you will get mixed results .
taken separately , they provide valuable information about future firm performance .
i guess it is time to get beyond the image of the greedy capitalist vs . hip ##pie tree hug ##ger in this discussion .
though that would make a great celebrity death match episode .
here are abstracts from 16 significant studies about socially responsible investing and an interesting essay on the subject .

i ' ll take a double shot
john a
2005 - 02 - 04 ##t ##11 : 55 : 00 yesterday was a tough day for the seattle scene .
amazon ended the day down 14 . 6 % .
starbucks down 8 . 2 % .
i should disclose that i spent a few years living in seattle and i have a soft spot in my heart for all things seattle .
as far as i could tell , many people in the northwest spend the mornings drinking la ##ttes and their evenings drinking micro ##bre ##ws .
really not a bad lifestyle .
anyway , back on topic here .
market over reaction ?
hard to say .
both companies have price ##y stocks and those valuation ##s are based on optimistic expectations of future growth .
yesterday ' s news led many to question their growth assumptions for these companies .
today i want to talk a bit about starbucks .
i think i have to start by acknowledging that the stock is still price ##y even after its drop yesterday .
however , my organizational indicators analysis reveals a very low level of business risk .
this may partially justify a higher p / e ratio .
a couple weeks ago , i observed that wal - mart had offset ##ting strong and weak organizational indicators .
starbucks , on the other hand , has uniformly strong organizational indicators .
starbucks scores as best in its industry on six of seven organizational indicators .
not surprising are its strong scores in the employee relations and stake ##holder actions indicators .
its weak ##est score is in the external reporting indicator .
in the past , several observers have raised concerns about aggressive accounting at starbucks but my analysis does not indicate any systematic current issues .
the weak score is primarily the result of starbucks current strategy of increasing equity ownership of several foreign subsidiaries .
this is a strategic shift that has short - term costs and adds some uncertainty to the financial statements .
beyond the strong organizational indicator analysis , several additional factors favor starbucks ability to continue to grow revenues .
1 .
starbucks has little debt .
starbucks is not currently financing its growth with debt .
considering its growth , this is amazing .
it also means that starbucks has a large amount of flexibility in how it finances future growth .
the company can assume much more debt without negatively affecting its risk profile because . . .
2 .
starbucks has a healthy cash ##flow and current cash position .
this allows the company to grow without debt .
you could argue that starbucks has too much cash and should do more to pass it on to shareholders .
this option is another way that starbucks has retained its flexibility for the future .
3 .
starbucks is the primary owner of its stores and limits fran ##chi ##sing .
while starbucks does partner ( airlines , airports , barnes & amp ; noble ) , most of its stores are company owned .
from a managerial perspective this greatly sim ##pl ##ifies cost structures , product changes , and quality control .
taken together all of these factors paint a picture of a company with a very strong future .
i can not say if these factors justify the current share price but i would say that they justify a higher p / e ratio than the industry norm .
risk is lower .
interesting aside : starbucks is taking over the location in my town that was recently abandoned by kris ##py k ##rem ##e .
disclosure : at the time of this writing i do not own starbucks stock . . . but i am tempted and might consider a buy next week .
i am also tempted to go buy a la ##tte after writing this post .

this is a medical mal ##pr ##actic ##e crisis .
over 80 , 000 americans , 220 every day die from medical negligence , hundred of thousands are injured .
and the insurance companies which had relatively steady rates on doctors for about 10 years have found its investment income , its interest income , the stock market collapse down . and so they ' re jack ##ing up the rates on a few key special ##ties like ob ##ste ##tric ##ians and ne ##uro ##sur ##ge ##ons .
but if you take the entire amount of premium ##s , bob , that ' s paid by doctors in this country to mal ##pr ##actic ##e ins ##urer ##s and divide it evenly , they ' d be paying less than $ 9 , 000 each . that ' s one - third of what they pay a receptionist .
novak that runs against the fact that so many of them are just leaving their practice because they ca n ' t afford it .
you know , ralph , you and i often agree on some things and one thing i think we agree on is the dirty effect of money and politics .
can you say that the lawyers , the trial lawyers who appoint millions and millions of dollars into democratic co ##ffer ##s in order to keep this , do you believe that this is healthy . . .
nad ##er well , as much as they ' ve poured into those co ##ffer ##s , it ' s much less than what the doctors , the mal ##pr ##actic ##e ins ##urer ##s , the hospital chains and the hm ##os and the nursing home chains have poured into members of congress ' co ##ffer ##s .
this is first and foremost , bob , a question of equity .
are we going to allow severely injured people who have found a lung taken out that ' s the wrong lung or a double mast ##ect ##omy that was n ' t indicated that was inflicted on a woman in the midwest , or that organ transplant that was incompatible on that 17 - year - old teenager in north carolina .
are we going to say to these and so many others , you ca n ' t have your full day in court ?
the congress is going to hand ##cu ##ff the judges and ju ##ries in the united states at the state court level ?
i have n ' t yet met one senator or representative who ' s for this bill who has demonstrated that the ju ##ror ##s in their home state and the judges in their home state are inc ##omp ##ete ##nt , unwilling or unable to perform justice in these medical mal ##pr ##actic ##e cases .
and i ' ve never heard one person say that the insurance executives who make $ 250 , 000 a week , every week without any pain and suffering , no one is saying cap those .
( applause )
beg ##ala dr . palm ##isan ##o , first thank you for being here .
dr . donald palm ##isan ##o , president - elect , ama thank you .
pleasure to be here .
beg ##ala there was a hear on capitol hill today .
and , i want to ask you to respond to one of the witnesses , john mccormick testified today .
he ' s the father of a little girl , 13 - month - old girl , who he said today died because of medical mal ##pr ##actic ##e .
he said that the hospital ignored abnormal co ##2 levels in her blood .
said that the attending physician had slept through several pages .
she died awaiting surgery .
listen to what mr . mccormick said and i ' ll ask you to respond .
( begin video clip )
john mccormick , father of mal ##pr ##actic ##e victim mr . president , from father to father , my family ' s pain and suffering are not fr ##ivo ##lous .
( end video clip )
beg ##ala is n ' t he right ?
is n ' t our president wrong to be - - did he win the lottery ?
you know , mr . bush - - president bush says these guys have won the litigation lottery .
does that look like a lottery winner to you , holding a picture of his dead baby ?
palm ##isan ##o well , the current medical liability system is affecting patients in that they ca n ' t get access to care .
the american medical association works very hard to make safety a priority in the medical care system .
that ' s why we founded the national patient safety foundation .
the current system does n ' t measure negligence .
it measures disability .
and what we ' re finding now is that the emergency rooms are closing , trauma centers are closing , pregnant women ca n ' t find a doctor to deliver the baby , a boy knocked unconscious has to be transported to another state .
another witness today told of what happened to her husband because there were no longer ne ##uro ##sur ##ge ##ons available in the community .
the patient had to be air ##ava ##cked and by that time it was too late to prevent the brain damage .
beg ##ala those are important points , i do n ' t doubt .
palm ##isan ##o yes .
beg ##ala but i wonder if you can respond to mr . mccormick ' s point .
who are you , who ' s our president to tell him that his suffering is only worth $ 250 , 000 for the loss of a child ?
palm ##isan ##o well , what has to be done here is balance .
what we need is a system that ' s fair to everyone , a system that keeps the physicians in practice and allows patients to have access to physicians in their hour of need . and the system in california that ' s in the bill , in congress now , hr - 5 , that ' s a system that has worked .
it brought stability to california and ob ##ste ##tric ##ians in california will pay 55 , 57 , $ 60 , 000 in los angeles and in south florida in miami , they ' ll pay $ 210 , 000 . . . ( cross ##talk )
nad ##er because in california they have regulated the insurance company premium levels .
and in florida , they ' ve been very weak on it .
and in some states , for example , there are doctors that are - - you know , there are 45 pay ##outs in ten years and they ' re not disciplined by the state medical board .
i mean , you ' ve got 5 percent of the doctors accounting for over 55 percent of the pay ##offs , paul .
in other words a small percentage of doctors that are bad , inc ##omp ##ete ##nt , indifferent , whatever .
they ' re not performing properly and the ama is not cracking down , is not supporting expansion to state licensing . . .
( cross ##talk )
palm ##isan ##o i want to respond to that .
the national practitioner data bank is the source of the information and it was brought up today .
first of all , the government accounting office criticized the methodology used .
it lists multiple claims against one physician when actually it ' s really one claim , different ins ##urer ##s pay on the same physician and it ' s counted as one claim .
it does n ' t mention whether they are ob ##ste ##tric ##ians , ne ##uro ##sur ##ge ##ons or emergency medicine .
it does n ' t list that .
right now in south florida , in south florida , the latest poll shows that every ne ##uro ##sur ##ge ##on has been sued .
the average number of suits against a ne ##uro ##sur ##ge ##on is five in south florida .
now are these bad doctors ?
we ' ll have no doctors , we ' ll have no ne ##uro ##sur ##ge ##ons , no ob ##ste ##tric ##ians . . .
novak we ' ve got to take a break .
nad ##er maybe they are bad doctors .

two reactions , two worlds
will ve ##hr ##s
2005 - 02 - 22 ##t ##0 ##8 : 17 : 00 del . adam e ##bb ##in ( d , alexandria ) is the first openly gay member to serve in the house of delegates .
there ' s a brief profile of e ##bb ##in by kristen gel ##ine ##au in today ' s daily press .
what i found interesting was the contrast in reactions to e ##bb ##in from two colleagues : " i suppose that one of the concerns was that since he is the only openly gay member of the legislature , is whether or not that would be the only issue that he would . . . talk about , " said del . ward armstrong , d - henry county .
" that clearly has not been the case .
he is a very versatile delegate . "
del . richard black , r - loud ##oun , who has compiled a track record as one of the most socially conservative members of the state legislature and was the sponsor of the gay adoption bill , said he ' s not trying to stamp out gay rights but is simply trying to preserve tradition .
as for his personal feelings on e ##bb ##in , after a lengthy pause , the loud ##oun republican offered : " he ' s always prompt and , you know , on time to meetings .
" a moment later , he added , " i think he works hard .
" i think it ' s possible to support some of black ' s positions but still be very disappointed by his cold assessment of a colleague .

i read black ' s comment as more genuine and straightforward than armstrong ' s .
i ' d much rather someone call me " prompt " and " hard - working " than " very versatile . " the latter sounds like weasel words - - " well , " johnnie ' s teacher said , " he ' s not too bright , and his table manners are at ##ro ##ct ##ious , but he ' s very versatile . "

virginia ' s anti - immigrant voice
will ve ##hr ##s
2005 - 02 - 26 ##t ##13 : 17 : 00 an old friend , joseph brit ##t of ken ##nes ##aw , ga , recently email ##ed to ask about anti - immigration as an issue for virginia democrats .
joe had just read a george w . grayson article in the william & mary alumni magazine , " myths about illegal immigration . "
grayson does not cite any virginia examples , but among the " myths " he attempts to explode are that illegal immigrants perform jobs americans do n ' t want and that they contribute more in taxes and social security than they take from government programs .
jim bacon
? ? ? ?
- ? ? - ? ? t ##11 : 25 : 00 i personally know a good number of immigrants , both legal and illegal .
one fellow , a brazilian , has done everything by the book .
he gets rewarded by having to pay an immigration attorney thousands of dollars while getting yanked around by the immigration service . . . not to mention , he ' s paying the government thousands in taxes .
he gets very frustrated because many of his contemporaries work for cash under the table .
they are n ' t paying lawyers , and they pay nothing into the system . of course , the americans who employ illegal immigrants are happy to pay in cash because it means cheaper labor for them .
who benefits ?
the illegal immigrants themselves , of course .
the employers who hire them instead of raising wages to attract native - born americans and legal immigrants .
and families who hire cheap domestic labor , whether to clean the house , wash the laundry or maintain the lawn .
who loses ?
poor , native - born americans who otherwise would be paid higher wages for their manual labor .
legal immigrants like my brazilian friend , who sometimes feels like a sap for playing by the rules .
and the rest of us who wo n ' t hire anyone to work for us unless they ' re paying their taxes , even if it means we pay more .
yeah , i ' ve got a problem with turning around and giving illegal immigrants all the rights and privileges of the native born and the legal immigrants who ' ve played by the rules .
yes , i do .

now that saddam hussein ' s regime has fallen is democracy the answer to iraq and its people .
in his book , fare ##ed za ##kar eric ##ks a joins us now to talk about democracy and iraq ' s future .
good to see you .
thank you , paula .
good to see you on a different network for a change .
that ' s what happens when you sell books .
i know .
let ' s talk about what barbara starr was reporting from the pentagon .
she says there is an ac ##k ##now ##led ##gm ##ent from those officials that there are not enough ground troops in place and particularly in baghdad to control what our nic robertson is saying is a stage of anarchy in some parts of iraq .
do you think the administration under ##est ##imated the day after ?
i think because the day after came so fast and so suddenly in way .
i think that there ' s been a pattern here not just with this administration , but over the last ten years , bosnia , kosovo , afghanistan , where we do n ' t quite recognize when the old order collapses , you very quickly have to rush in and fill it with some kind of new order .
in the short - term , that ' s going to have to mean the american military .
but the key question , which i try to address in the book , is what do you do after that ?
what kind of authority do you create in a society going through this kind of transition . and how do you know that the local iraqi citizens will make up this government or , in fact , interested in democracy ?
there ' s no proof of that .
well , the key here is the only way to get that kind of legitimate government to have it look good is to hold elections .
but if you hold elections , you stop the whole process of building a rule of law , creating courts , creating administration .
we ' ve seen in the past in bosnia for example , you held elections and all of the old ethnic thugs get into power because they have organization and they have money and they stop the process of genuine building of democracy .
there is this tension here which is the only way to make this look good is in some way get legitimate iraqi authority , but the faster you get that , the more likely you stop this process .
so what do you think of this interim government ?
you got deputy defense secretary paul wolf ##ow ##itz saying that american and british military forces would play a leading role in setting up an iraqi government and then later draw civilians into the process .
is that going to work ?
i think it will work if it ' s truly broad - based and truly con ##sen ##su ##al , try and include all different people and including them in creating a constitution which would take a few years .
what i point out is the plays where you ' ve had quick transitions

2 , 500 japanese students in osaka protest against iraq war
tokyo , march 30 ( af ##p )
some 2 , 500 mainly university students formed a human chain in japanese characters spelling out " no war " in osaka on sunday to protest against the ongoing us - led military campaign in iraq .
" we can not forgive this war , " mi ##ya ##ko fuji , 20 , one of the rally ' s organise ##rs told ji ##ji news agency .
" i want to join together the feelings of each of us as individuals who oppose the war . "
protesters , who exceeded the 2 , 000 expected to show up at the park at osaka castle in the city ' s downtown neighbourhood , carried pl ##aca ##rds that read " stop war " and " love and peace " while forming the human chain after 3 : 00 pm ( 06 ##00 gm ##t ) , ji ##ji said .
the protest follows a string of others involving tens of thousands of peace activists across japan since january .
according to a poll by ky ##od ##o news agency released saturday , 78 of 100 people surveyed opposed the military action in iraq .
a separate poll of 1 , 84 ##6 adults by the leading yo ##mi ##uri newspaper published tuesday showed 64 percent felt japan had " no choice " but to back the united states , with only 12 percent saying japan had " every reason " to back the war .

at least 200 , 000 in us , canadian anti - war demonstrations = ( pictures ) = attention - updates , adds details / / /
new york , march 23 ( af ##p )
some 70 people were arrested saturday as demonstrators clashed with police at the end of a major peace rally here , as at least 200 , 000 anti - war protesters took to the streets across the united states and canada .
for the most part the marches went off peacefully , but in new york a small group of protesters were arrested after they refused to go home at the end of their rally , police sources said .
several police officers were treated for the effects of gas after the ensuing clashes - - a result , police said , of the demonstrators using self - defence devices .
organise ##rs claimed that some 250 , 000 people attended the rally , creating a human column some three kilometres ( 1 . 8 miles ) long . police put the at ##tan ##dance at around 125 , 000 .
the city assigned 2 , 000 police officers to the rally , including undercover officers who carried bee ##per - sized radiation detectors and other counter - terrorism equipment .
though opinion polls have shown public support for the war rising in the united states , opposition to military intervention in iraq has given rise to an imp ##ass ##ioned campaign .
among the sea of banners making its way up broadway were many signs poking fun at president george w . bush . " somewhere in texas , a village is missing an idiot , " said one sign .
" iraq war : an une ##le ##cted ex ##tre ##mist vs . an une ##le ##cted ex ##tre ##mist , " and " take the toys away from junior . "
one woman marched top ##less with the words " shock and awe " da ##ub ##ed across her back in red ink , a reference to the bombing campaign unleashed friday on baghdad .
lia ##na owen drove 10 hours from pennsylvania to attend the rally in manhattan with her parents .
" it ' s important that people all over the world know that we do n ' t believe in the war , " she said .
several thousand demonstrators also gathered outside the white house in washington , accompanied by a major security presence .
" they can say they ' re ' smart bombs , ' but smart bombs are n ' t able to distinguish between military and human targets , " abigail fletcher , a marche ##r from florida , said outside the president ' s residence .
some of the slogan ##s sought to re ##bu ##t war supporters ' arguments that the protests are un ##pa ##tri ##otic .
" we support our troops - - bring them home ! " read one .
a former service ##man , michael schmidt of pe ##oria , illinois , said : " it ' s up to me to help the us - - from here . "
others were more blunt , with one banner reading " shocked , awe ##d - - and disgusted . "
one group , lesbian ##s against boys invading anything , carried signs saying " pre - em ##ptive war is terrorism , " " this is n ' t the usa i love , " and " where will the bombs fall next ? "
up to 20 , 000 protesters th ##rong ##ed the plaza ##s and streets of san francisco , where more than 1 , 600 people were arrested in the past two days in a civil di ##so ##bed ##ience campaign .
between 2 , 500 and 3 , 000 people picket ##ed the cnn studios in los angeles while others at the atlanta headquarters protested the cable network ' s coverage of the war for being biased toward the united states .
" they make this look like a john wayne movie , " said protest ##er elvis woods .
" you watch cnn and all you get are explosions and video of tanks and guns .
nobody questions whether this is right or not . "
counter - demonstrations in support of the us - led invasion of iraq took place in some cities , with some 2 , 500 people turning out in chicago . flying the us flag and rec ##iting the pledge of allegiance , they outnumbered their anti - war counterparts by three to one .
passions ran deep on both sides , but a line of police in riot gear kept them apart .
carrying signs that said , " it ' s the oil , stupid , " and " real men do n ' t bomb children , " the anti - war protesters waved blue earth flags .
" i agree saddam is crazy and needs to go , but it ' s not our place to do it , " said ian wi ##s ##nie ##wski , 14 , who had a fake bullet hole painted on his forehead .
" it ' s crazy that we ' re bombing iraq .
it sick ##ens me . "
a few yards away , claire tor ##tore ##llo , 54 , pointed and yelled at the protesters across the plaza .
holding a framed picture of her son , serving with the army ' s 3rd infantry division in iraq , she said she did n ' t know whether he was dead or alive .
" i ' m here to support him and others who are fighting for their country .
they would n ' t be here if it were n ' t for the freedoms that others fought for , " she said .
anti - war protests took place around the world saturday after the start of the bombing of baghdad .
hundreds of thousands of demonstrators took to the streets in britain , spain and italy , whose governments approved of the war .
in montreal , " stop the war , " a coalition of more than 190 groups , said as many as 200 , 000 people turned out , though police refused to give a figure .
protesters also gathered in their thousands in halifax , calgary , edmonton and vancouver .
organizers of the civil di ##so ##bed ##ience campaigns promised to block intersections and bridges , shack ##le themselves to lamp ##post ##s and create human cord ##ons to snarl traffic , as long as the war continues .
some 3 , 000 people have been arrested since the di ##so ##bed ##ience campaigns began last week .
