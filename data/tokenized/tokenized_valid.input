new questions about attacking iraq ; is tor ##turing terrorists necessary ?
novak welcome back .
orders went out today to deploy 17 , 000 u . s . army soldiers in the persian gulf region .
the army ' s entire first cal ##vary division based at fort hood , texas , would join the quarter million u . s . forces already in the region .
we ' re talking about possibilities of full scale war with former congressman tom andrews , democrat of maine .
he ' s now national director of win without war , and former congressman bob do ##rna ##n , republican of california .
beg ##ala bob , one of the reasons i think so many americans are worried about this war and so many people around the world do n ' t want to go is there have been a lot of problems with credibility from this administration .
our president has repeatedly , for example , relied on a man whom you ' re aware , hussein kam ##el , saddam hussein ' s son - in - law , leader of the iraq arms program who defected for a time .
and gave us a whole lot of information and then went home and his father - in - law killed him .
bad move .
but while he was here , he gave us a whole lot of information .
gave us a whole lot of information .
well , our president told us that information proves that the dictator had chemical weapons , which is true .
but what we just learned this week from " newsweek " magazine which got a hold of the de ##bri ##ef ##ings , is that he also told us it was destroyed back in 1995 .
why has n ' t our president told us that ?
why do we have to learn it from " newsweek " ?
do ##rna ##n i do n ' t believe that he believed it was all destroyed .
the fact that this guy was such an idiot to go back and let his father - in - law kill him shows he was n ' t the most stable of people .
but the things that . . .
beg ##ala good point .
but should n ' t our president have told us what the cia told him .
why do we learn from " newsweek ? " should he level with us ?
do ##rna ##n paul , look , the problem is i would st ##ip ##ulate all four of us hates war . any rational person hates war .
bush is n ' t sitting in that white house not thinking about the body bags coming home with great young men .
clinton suffered greatly over the 19 rangers that died , 18 on the 3rd of october and matt re ##ers ##en ( ph ) three days later .
i visited all their families .
i was at the medal of honor ceremony for the kids .
let me tell you , what trips to walter reed taught me was , that whoever thought up the term , the law of un ##int ##ended consequences it per ##tain ##s to war .
i am shook over the aftermath .
but , this guy is a monster , a mini - me hitler .
he will blow a city off the earth in a minute if he can get the hold of the means to do it .
novak tom andrews , i think we all realize that a government does n ' t go to war a nation goes to war .
and so i would like you to take a look at the cnn / " usa today " / gall ##up poll , taken last week , should u . s . troops to go to iraq to remove saddam hussein from power .
take a look at it .
favor 59 % , opposed 37 % , that ' s a vastly larger support than president bush senior had in getting the u . s . troops out of kuwait before that war started . that ' s pretty good support is n ' t it ?
andrews now , bob , come on you do n ' t really buy this .
i mean , listen , this is the oldest trick in the book .
you can have a general question like this that could mean anything and ask people and they give you what comes off the top of their head .
but , ask them another question , ask them what they think about spending $ 1 . 3 trillion in destroying this economy .
ask them about going and not just a war , bob , but an invasion and occupying for up to 10 years a sovereign arab nation in the midst of one of the most di ##sta ##ble and volatile regions in the world .
ask them how they feel about getting bog ##ged down .
well , i ' ve seen some of the figures .
once you start telling americans the story , - - the administration refuse today tell us story .
they ' re not coming forward and telling us what the risks are , what the costs are , how many years we might be in , the possibility of us getting bog ##ged down , because what americans know that , they ' re opposed to this war .
the more they learn about this invasion , the more they learn about this occupation , the less they support it .
do ##rna ##n tom , you know what liberals want .
they do n ' t want a smoking gun , they want a smoking city .
the clinton people all say . . .
beg ##ala that ' s going to have to be last war , unfair and unfortunate as that is , i am sorry , they ' re telling us we ' re out of time .
former congressman , bob do ##rna ##n from california . . .
do ##rna ##n you ' re not going to get a smoking city .

tu ##chman ( voice - over ) as they get ready to head over hostile territory , 10 men aboard this air force hc - 130 search and rescue and refueling plane start to feel their adrenaline rushing .
who looks out for the unlikely prospect of iraqi aircraft , and the more likely prospect of iraqi missiles or artillery . ( on camera ) : does your minds ##et change across the border into iraq ?
unidentified male no , because i am in an area which i do n ' t know where the enemy could be and i might get to the airplane , by the time i get out of the airplane i ' m thinking the same way .
tu ##chman which is ?
unidentified male the hair on the back of my neck starts standing up , then something ' s going wrong .
tu ##chman ( voice - over ) as a pre ##ca ##ution , the crew starts turning the huge plane in circles to see what the targets do .
ultimately it ' s discovered the targets are u . s . combat helicopters .
minutes later the search and rescue helicopter arrives for its refueling .
watch the flash from our night vision camera as the plane ' s fuel line connects with the chopper .
both aircraft fly at 125 miles per hour gingerly over enemy land .
at times they are only 50 feet apart with the chopper ' s rotor blades getting closer .
looking with the naked eye out of the plane , the helicopter is impossible to see .
the pitch - black maneuver ends after 10 minutes .
( on camera ) : what stops though - we know the iraqi ##s have fired sand missiles and fired aaa at aircraft all throughout this war .
they have n ' t hit anybody , but is n ' t it risky flying so low knowing they have that ammunition to fire at you .
unidentified male again , we know where we ' re going .
we know where they ' re at so we simply avoid them and if for some reason they do get off a lucky shot or they do see us , we have defensive systems on board the airplane to defeat their ammunition .
tu ##chman we all fly with bullet ##proof vest ##s in case the plane goes down .
we also fly with parachute ##s in case we need to get out before the plane goes down .
( voice - over ) : but three airmen aboard this plane have parachute ##s for a different reason .
they are the para ##res ##cu ##e jumper ##s , or p ##js who jump off the plane for rescue missions .
unidentified male i mean it ' s probably the most - the best feeling in the world knowing that your purpose is really defined at that moment .
tu ##chman no rescues were necessary on this sort ##ie .
the plane arrived back to base safely .
( on camera ) : do you have any fear ?
unidentified male everybody has a little bit of fear but i think it ' s a good thing in this circumstance .
tu ##chman ( voice - over ) this crew could be back on another mission in as few as 24 hours .
( end video ##ta ##pe )
tu ##chman this is a very busy base .
we want to give you a look right now at the aircraft coming in for landings .
it looks like lax on a sunday night and this is what it ' s been like for the past 11 days .
we have just watched multitude ##s of warp ##lane ##s land , multitude ##s of warp ##lane ##s take off and this may be the busiest night of the campaign .
they ' re expecting a total at this particular base near the iraqi border of 300 sort ##ies in a 24 - hour period ending today according to the air force total from all the bases and there are more than 30 bases in 12 different countries in the middle east according to the pentagon .
they ' re saying there will be 1500 sort ##ies in a 24 - hour period ending tomorrow .
eight hundred of those sort ##ies will be strike sort ##ies using bombs and missiles so there is no slow down in the amount of air power being used over iraq .
wolf , back to you .
blitz ##er that ' s a lot of bombs and missiles .
gary tu ##chman in an air base near the iraq border , thanks very much , gary tu ##chman .
this programming note , tomorrow at noon eastern i ' ll have a special interview with the nation ' s top military officer , the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff .
general richard myers will be my special guest on a special late addition .
that ' s at noon eastern , nine a . m . pacific tomorrow .

well , as coalition forces push north , they are encounter ##ing a unique problem of combat , getting rid of the weapons captured from the enemy .
some of the 40 , 000 british troops are kicking up a lot of dust in the iraqi desert making sure that nothing is left behind them that could hurt them .
greg mil ##am is with the u . k . forces in southern iraq .
( begin video ##ta ##pe )
greg mil ##am , cnn correspondent seemingly deserted , these battered buildings hold a deadly threat to british forces in iraq .
sergeant geoff ban ##ham , royal engineers this is what we ' re coming across a lot of these , 30 mil , 60 mil , 80 mil , even 120 mil .
so there ' s plenty still out there that will have to be recovered because they can be used .
mil ##am do you know when this place was last used ?
i mean do you know ( un ##int ##elli ##gible )
ban ##ham i ' m not too sure but judging by some of this , it ' s been here quite a long time so whether it ' s been used recently by them - there was an intel upbeat saying that they were possibly coming back to try and get this to use against them .
mil ##am grenades , mortar ##s , all sorts of ammunition abandoned by iraqi soldiers but there for the taking .
the job of these royal engineers is to clear this and many other mountains of armament ##s and destroy them .
some are too unstable to be moved and have to be blown up on the spot .
the rest is carried way out into the desert .
and today ' s parts in this conflict , this kind of work becomes more and more important .
with the coalition forces moving forward the last thing they want is weaponry like this lurking behind them .
captain andy goo ##ch , royal engineers with the amounts of ammunition and weapons left about , if they ' d used those systems , that amount of weapon it would have given us a considerable amount of trouble trying to take the positions .
mil ##am with much of this weaponry there is only one safe thing to do .
no one in the british forces here is willing to take any risks .

push to baghdad begins ; pow safe in army ' s care
wolf blitz ##er , cnn anchor hi , judy .
thank you very much .
as of an hour or so ago , we got word from the battlefield that u . s . forces were just 15 miles away from the southern edge of baghdad .
and they may be even closer right now .
the tough ##est fight , though , may lie ahead in the heart of the iraqi capital . pentagon sources say the first phase of the final push into baghdad is now under way .
u . s . - led forces were able to press farther north after defeating iraqi republican guard units at ka ##rba ##la and ku ##t ( ph ) .
our embedded reporters say the two - pro ##nged advance appears to be moving faster than commanders expected .
the pentagon says two of the republican guard divisions defending baghdad are no longer credible forces .
scenes from na ##ja ##f may also be bo ##lster ##ing the troops ' spirit .
iraqi ##s who initially were cautious when u . s . forces arrived in na ##ja ##f ended cheering them on , shaking their hands and patting their backs .
u . s . army ' s 7th cavalry is in the forefront of u . s . troops since they first left kuwait and crossed directly into the iraqi desert .
our walter rodgers is embedded with the unit ' s 3rd squadron , which is leading the 3rd infantry division ' s march toward the iraqi capital .
( begin video ##ta ##pe )
walter rodgers , cnn correspondent throughout the day , as the u . s . army 7th cavalry punched northward in the general direction of baghdad , we have seen huge convoys of supply troops moving ever northward .
indeed , all the arrows on the army ' s map seem to be pointing in the direction of the southern suburbs of baghdad .
earlier in the day , the 1st brigade of the 3rd infantry division took ka ##rba ##la with a minimum of fight .
and then the 3rd brigade of the 3rd infantry division secured the town of ka ##rba ##la .
additionally , the 7th cavalry has pushed onward in the general direction of baghdad .
yesterday we were about 50 miles from the southern suburbs of baghdad .
we have perhaps have that distance .
throughout the day , we have watched the 3rd infantry division bring in prisoners of war .
iraqi soldiers glad the war is over for them , perhaps 100 at a time .
there were times when the 7th cavalry itself got into some skirmish ##es as it pushed forward , again in the direction of baghdad .
there was a bit of a fire ##fight when the 7th cavalry came upon three soviet vintage 20 - mill ##imeter anti - aircraft guns , ac ##k - ac ##k guns .
the iraqi unit in possession of those guns fired mortar ##s in the direction of the 7th cavalry .
the apache troop opened its tank guns , opened its own mortar ##s , dec ##imated that unit , put it out of existence and probably killed some 20 iraqi ##s in the process .
this as it continues to push ever closer towards the southern suburbs of baghdad .
walter rodgers , cnn , with the u . s . 7th cavalry in the iraqi desert .

blitz ##er and it ' s a similar story from cnn ' s karl pen ##ha ##ul who is now just miles from the southern outskirts of the iraqi capital .
he ' s embedded with the u . s . army ' s 11th attack helicopter regiment .
here ' s his report just filed a few minutes ago .
( begin video ##ta ##pe )
karl pen ##ha ##ul , cnn correspondent ( voice - over ) the speed as they push to baghdad seems to have gathered pace overnight and in the course of this morning .
in fact , it ' s going much faster than many of the u . s . commanders on the ground predicted .
capt . brian mcc ##ort , pilot the intensity it ' s very quick moving , very fluid battle .
the armor , and mechanized infantry , and artillery pieces and personnel on the ground are moving at rapid speeds .
pen ##ha ##ul overnight and early this morning , the tanks and bradley fighting vehicles of the 3rd infantry division backed by the apache attack helicopters of the 11th aviation regiment punched through the republican guard defenses in and around ka ##rba ##la .
they were then able to advance far north of that city and , as we speak , u . s . commanders tell me that elements of the 3rd infantry division are now literally just a few miles from baghdad .

u . s . forces hunt for last of saddam ' s loyal fighters
wood ##ruff you are looking at live pictures of the white house where president bush watched some of the television coverage of events in baghdad today . separately , vice president cheney shared his thoughts in a speech in new orleans .
with me now for more on all this , cnn ' s senior white house correspondent john king .
john , they have to be happy there .
john king , cnn s ##nr . white house correspondent judy , they are .
behind the scenes privately here you get a pal ##pa ##ble sense of vin ##dication , although publicly caution is the watch ##word here , administration officials from the vice president on down saying the war is not over yet .
some of the tough ##est fighting could still be ahead . mostly they believe in those northern iraq areas brent sadler was just talking about before the break .
but they do believe the pictures out of baghdad today , on the one hand , send as powerful a message as you can send to the people in the arab world who have criticized this war .
people in baghdad celebrating .
u . s . troops assisting in pulling down that statue of saddam hussein .
across the arab world , the administration hopes to send a signal that the united states is there to help the iraqi people regain control of their own country , as a liberty , not as any imperial or occupying force .
of course , at the same time , though , the white house worries that the american people might see these pictures and think the war is over .
defense secretary rum ##sf ##eld and vice president cheney among those saying the tough ##est fighting might still lie ahead , still una ##ns ##wer ##ed questions about the whereabouts of saddam hussein and other key members of the iraqi leadership .
the vice president made that argument today .
but even as he sounds that note of caution , you do sense a little tiny bit of we told you so .
( begin video clip )
dick cheney , vice president of the united states bottom line , with less than half of the ground forces and two - thirds of the air assets used 12 years ago in desert storm , secretary rum ##sf ##eld and general franks have achieved a far more difficult objective .
yet until this war is fully won , we can not be over ##con ##fide ##nt in our position .
and we must not under ##est ##imate the desperation of whatever forces remain loyal to the dictator .
( end video clip )
king we will not hear from the president today , we are told , but before the week is out and perhaps as early as tomorrow officials say the president is likely to offer his thoughts on the challenges just ahead .
so , again , behind the scenes , a sense of vin ##dication , but also a cautious attitude because of the fighting still to come .
i have to tell you , though , judy , the cia director george ten ##et walked out of the white house a short time ago with a giant smile on his face .
i can not recall a moment since september 11 , 2001 and those tragic events when we have seen the cia director look so happy .
wood ##ruff well , john , given all that you ' ve said , we know that there ' s an american retired general waiting in kuwait .
but in addition to that , what steps are they already taking at the white house to plan for a post - saddam hussein government in iraq ?
king they are planning to accelerate that planning process .
jay garner the retired general will go into iraq soon with his troops soon .
i say troops .
they are civilians from the u . s . government .
that will take place soon .
they are awaiting for word from the pentagon that it believes the security environment is secure enough for that to happen .
and beginning as early as next week , there will be a series of town meetings , if you will .
the invitations will be issued by general tommy franks .
they are trying to identify iraqi ##s from within the country , as well as iraqi di ##ssi ##dents and exiles , the diaspora they call it here at the white house , who will be part of a planning process to begin the process - - they say it could takes weeks or more - - of selecting who should be part of that interim iraqi authority .
now , we know , one person who will be invited is planning process , those planning meetings , is ahmed cha ##lab ##i .
he is the leader of the iraqi national congress .
he is known to be a favorite of vice president dick cheney , of defense secretary rum ##sf ##eld and secretary rum ##sf ##eld ' s top deputy , paul wolf ##ow ##itz .
he will be involved in the planning and in those meetings .
but i also should report that there is a sense of annoyance here at the white house , even among some of mr . cha ##lab ##i ' s top supporters , that , since returning to iraq in recent days , he has complained frequently , including on our air earlier today , that the united states is moving too slowly to get in the reconstruction efforts , to restore electricity and restore water .
over at the pentagon today , defense secretary rum ##sf ##eld , again , a supporter of mr . cha ##lab ##i , said that , in his view , services were already at their pre ##war levels .
and mr . rum ##sf ##eld went on to say , secretary rum ##sf ##eld went on to say , there is still a war going on , still quite a dangerous situation - - judy .
wood ##ruff yes , we caught some of that irritation in his choice .
all right , john king , our senior white house correspondent , thank you .
still to come : warfare amid the celebrations in baghdad .
as iraqi ##s poured into the streets to mark their apparent new freedom , american troops come under fire from a different area .
cnn ' s martin sa ##vid ##ge will show us what they came up against at baghdad university .

ethical and legal issues in hiring marine ##llo

ethical and legal issues in hiring marine ##llo
it has been suggested that there is , or was at one time , some sort of delegates ' motion which established a minimum period between the time someone could leave the e ##b and the time someone could be hired by the usc ##f . i do n ' t know if this is so , and i really think it ' s sort of irrelevant .
it ' s irrelevant because the real question is whether an active board member can , while on the board , arrange to be given money by the usc ##f .
of course it ' s in the by ##law ##s that an active board member can not be given money by the usc ##f while on the board .
it ought to be pretty obvious that it would be entirely contrary to the spirit of this for an active board member to be money after leaving the board .
suppose , for example , there were to be a proposal to the effect that each e ##b member would be given $ 10 , 000 upon the ex ##piration of his / her term .
clearly this would be a transparent attempt to evade the by ##law ##s and would fail .
if the board can not vote to give themselves present money , they can not vote to give themselves future money either .
furthermore , it does n ' t matter whether this arrangement is embodied in an e ##b vote or not , or whether the discussion of the proposal takes place in a formal e ##b meeting or not .
a board member , while on the board , is supposed to be representing the interests of the usc ##f , not feather ##ing his / her nest , in the present or in the future .
if a board member makes such arrangements , it is clearly an ethics violation , clearly a violation of the by ##law ##s , possibly end ##anger ##s our tax - exempt status , and is possibly a violation of law as well .
the purpose of having a " time limit " would be as a mechanism to ensure compliance with the above principles ; that is , you would have a time limit because it would reduce the likelihood that someone would be tempted to violate the above prohibition ; it would give the voters time to elect a new e ##b that would consider the issues objective ##ly .
of course , it is possible that someone could leave the board - without - ever having discussed being compensated by the board in the future , and that then the remaining members could , for good reason , hire that person .
it would create questions among the suspicious - and avoiding this appearance of wrong ##do ##ing would be another good reason for a time limit - but it would n ' t automatically be an ethics or by ##law ##s violation .
but this is neither here nor there , because the fact that randy bauer is already talking about beat ##riz marine ##llo as the usc ##f ' s new " move coordinator " , whatever that involves , and whether or not it means that she would be the de facto interim ed , means that at some level and in some form these discussions have already taken place , while marine ##llo is serving as president .
i mean , it ' s con ##ce ##iva ##ble that the other six have all gotten together in marine ##llo ' s absence and drafted her , but it also seems pretty clear that she has agreed to do it , and , if all the rumors are true and she steps down , it will be so that she can take on these new responsibilities . so the ' time limit ' issue does n ' t even come up .
we pretty much know that marine ##llo , while on the board , has arranged to get future money from the usc ##f .
so we already have a problem .
if this is not a problem , i wish someone would explain to me why not .
now , stan b . argues that marine ##llo ' s services are in fact ind ##is ##pen ##sible as move coordinator , and that ethics standards are not a suicide pact , so that since we absolutely need her the e ##b has the right to go ahead and retain her .
i agree with the principle .
but i think that to make this argument work the e ##b would have to produce some evidence that marine ##llo really is ind ##is ##pen ##sible for this task .
this would have to include evidence that the e ##b had considered all the alternatives , including :
- del ##ega ##ting the whole thing to the interim ed , which would be the normal practice in normal organizations with an ed
- asking the interim ed to designate someone from the new windsor staff to act as move coordinator
- asking the interim ed to hire some other consultant with experience in office relocation to manage the job ( there are such people )
- conducting some kind of actual search for candidates for the position during the last two months since the move was decided upon
if they did consider alternatives , it would also have to include evidence that marine ##llo has much more experience at relocating offices than other people , or is willing to do the job cheaper ( although this would n ' t constitute being " ind ##is ##pen ##sible " in my view ) .
if , however , they just looked around the room and said " who is going to manage this ? " and someone said , " beat ##riz , how about you ? " , this does not constitute proof that her services are ind ##is ##pen ##sible , and thus it would n ' t interfere with my belief that there has been an ethics violation and a by ##law ##s violation .
one very bad argument that was made by kevin bach ##ler , which to be fair was surrounded by arguably better ones , was that since this board was elected , we should let them do as they please .
which is to say that there might as well not be by ##law ##s , ethics standards , laws , etc . , since an elected board is not bound by any of them .
i think this idea should be rejected .
another argument , which is better but still disturbing , is that , yes , this is an ethics violation , and maybe worse , but it would only hurt the usc ##f to talk about it , and that only trouble ##makers like sam sloan , larry par ##r , and , i suppose , me , would talk about it , since doing so will ob ##st ##ru ##ct the federation ' s plans , cause us to pay legal expenses , run the risk of our being stuck without any office space at all , cause people not to loan us money , and so forth .
so we should all ignore this because it is realistic to do so .
i ' m not entirely un ##sy ##mp ##ath ##etic to this , actually .
but frankly i think that a whole lot of the problems the usc ##f has had over the years have had to do with well - intention ##ed people keeping secrets because bringing them out in the open would harm the usc ##f , and as a result we have awful habits which hurt the usc ##f even worse .
but if we are going to talk about realism , here is another realistic concern : i predict that , if , in fact , the rumors about the agenda for the florida meeting prove true , and marine ##llo resign ##s as president and is hired as move coordinator , the immediate result of this is that sam sloan will file another lawsuit ( or amend his current complaint ) charging the usc ##f e ##b members with self - dealing , violation of the usc ##f ' s own by ##law ##s , and every other thing , report us to the irs , and demand that all usc ##f money ##s which might be used to paid marine ##llo be frozen .
this is not based on any communication from sam , direct or indirect .
it is just logical .
if he is willing to file a lawsuit on the basis of new york non - profit organization law , which might or might not be applicable to the usc ##f , why would n ' t he file a lawsuit on the basis of the usc ##f ' s violation of its own by ##law ##s , which un ##quest ##ion ##ably are applicable to the usc ##f ?
i wrote a few days ago quoting my own employer association ' s attorney , who said that courts mostly let associations do what they want unless they violate their own by ##law ##s .
it is irritating enough to get sued by sam sloan ; imagine how irritating it would be to get sued by sam sloan and beaten by sam sloan because you have done something so e ##gre ##gio ##us that a court is forced to agree with him .

board member compensation
hello all ,
what is the recommended policy on com ##pen ##sat ##ing board members for attending meetings , when they have no vacation time left at work , and are attending the board meeting on their own time , without pay .
we do n ' t want to lose the contributions of this board member , but this has become a financial issue . thanks .

if your organization is a charity , it is generally considered to be inappropriate , and in some jurisdictions , it is illegal to compensate board members for their service .
you should check out the law in your state and / or country .
it is reasonable , however , to rei ##mb ##urse board members for legitimate and necessary expenses incurred in order to serve on the board .
i wonder if you could make a case for paying someone to replace the board member so the board member can attend meetings .
i ' m not a lawyer , but it seems to me to be similar to rei ##mb ##urs ##ing a board member for a baby ##sit ##ter , which no one questions .
another possibility is to change the meeting times .

re : board member compensation
we are incorporated in maryland .
there are just 5 of us on the board ( we are a charity 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) , although we all live in different states from coast to coast .
it is very difficult to find times for all of us to get together . would i need to check the maryland law or the law in the state in which this board member lives ?
thanks .

re : board member compensation
in irs publication 55 ##7 , the sample draft articles of incorporation indicate that no compensation may be paid to directors .
in fairness , rei ##mb ##urse ##ment of out - of - pocket expenses on behalf of the organization - - including travel and lodging to attend board meetings - - are allowed .
however , publication 55 ##7 does not explicitly prohibit compensation to directors .
as far as state laws go , you must follow the laws for the states ( 1 ) in which the organization is incorporated and ( 2 ) in which the organization operates .
for an organization that is incorporated in maryland and has its headquarters in maryland , the laws of maryland apply without regard to the states in which the directors live . remember , a corporation is legally a " person " , distinct from the corp ##ore ##al persons who govern , manage , and operate the corporation . thus , the laws applying to the corporate person are the laws of the state where that person " lives " . - -

it is very legal , and an acceptable policy or practice in canada to pay an honor ##arium or st ##ipe ##nt for people on boards that are active .
many do this , as they know it is an investment for the time and talents they need .
they also know , as do the recipients , the payment is but a percentage of the true worth of the time and effort , but does show respect for what they are rec ##ieving .

yes .
some head start agencies , community health centers , and similar nonprofit organizations serving low - income people have a requirement for " consumer " representation on their boards .

re : board member compensation
actually , it would not be ad ##vis ##able to accept freddy ' s comments at face value .
it is not acceptable policy and not legal to pay an honor ##arium or st ##ipe ##nd to directors of charities .
i checked with a lawyer familiar with canadian charity law , who explained that it is not permitted to re ##mun ##erate board members of charities for their service as board members .
the prohibition does not apply to directors of nonprofit organizations that are not charities .
in the usa , the rules vary from state to state .
some states permit board members of charities to be compensated , but it is generally not done . donors , fund ##ers , and the general public share the view that directors of charities should act gr ##at ##uit ##iously .
it is permitted everywhere , however , to rei ##mb ##urse directors for necessary expenses incurred in order to serve .
if your organization is a charity , you need to check your state law and act very carefully if you are considering paying board members .

being someone that works and lives in canada , and in the non - profit industry , it is done , and it is very legal .
take a look at any of the large student unions , they all pay their elected board members an honor ##arium , as do many of the large foundations .
it is legal , and it is done .

france & terrorism
curt
2005 - 02 - 17 ##t ##12 : 37 : 00 got ta hate the french , i really do n ' t think there is anything good you can say about the french anymore , they are a waste and a joke of a government .
apparently bush wants the european ' s to classify hezbollah as a terrorist group .
makes sense right ?
as rising instability in lebanon increases tensions in the middle east , the bush administration is arguing with european governments over whether they should designate the lebanon - based shi ##ite group hezbollah a terrorist organization , american and european officials say .
the united states is already stepping up pressure on iran and syria , hezbollah ' s main sponsors .
the american rift with syria deepened this week , with suspicions that syria might have been behind the assassination of lebanon ' s former prime minister in beirut on monday .
. . .
in the past two weeks , the officials said , france has re ##bu ##ffed appeals by secretary of state condo ##lee ##zza rice and the israeli foreign minister , silva ##n sha ##lom , to list hezbollah as a terrorist organization , which would prevent it from raising money in europe through charity groups .
the united states has long called hezbollah a terrorist organization , but the french , american and european officials said , have opposed doing so , and argue that making such a designation now would be un ##wise , given the new turbulence in lebanon .
israeli and american officials say that the palestinian president , mahmoud abbas , has told them that he , too , regards hezbollah as a destructive force in the middle east , one determined to undermine peace talks by supporting militant groups that attack israelis .
got ta love that .
the palestinian president admits that hezbollah are a bunch of f - wa ##d terrorists but the french do n ' t agree . . . .
no joke .
the europeans are not solid ##ly opposed to listing hezbollah as a terrorist group , the officials said .
the netherlands , italy and poland support the bush administration ' s view , several officials said , while germany and britain believe the issue is mo ##ot unless the french change their minds .
one european diplomat said other countries were " hiding behind " france on the issue .
. . .
a european diplomat said the issue of calling hezbollah a terrorist organization was discussed in brussels on wednesday at a meeting of the clearing house , a unit of the european union that meets in confidential sessions to review terrorist activities in europe .
the group could reach no consensus , the diplomat said .
" nothing is going to change on hezbollah because we do n ' t have an agreement among the member states , " the diplomat said .
" that does n ' t mean we wo n ' t get a consensus .
i know the americans are impatient , but the european union has 25 states , and these things take time .
" some of those interviewed tried to make it sound as if the reason they are hesitant to go along with bush is because of the situation in lebanon .
but as the captain points out , it probably has more to do with iran :
i suspect the true reason for the reluctance comes not from the " delicate " nature of lebanese politics , but from the relationship between hezbollah and the iranian ##s .
the eu has tried for the past two years to app ##ease the iranian mu ##llah ##s into giving up their nuclear - weapons ambitions to little avail .
they do n ' t want to rock the boat now by attempting to star ##ve out the mu ##llah ##s ' terror agent that conducts the proxy attacks against israel that iran can not afford to do itself openly .
they did not learn from hitler ' s germany i guess , they tried to app ##ease that guy too .
this whole thing just reminds me how corrupt and useless france is . they will forever be known as that corrupt and coward ##s in my opinion .
read from on high , dh ##im ##mi watch , crank ##y neo ##con , and my view of the world for more .

2004 - 11 - 16 ##t ##13 : 47 : 00 from reuters : u . s . marines rallied round a comrade under investigation for killing a wounded iraqi during the offensive in fall ##uj ##a , saying he was probably under combat stress in unpredictable , hair - trigger circumstances .
marines interviewed on tuesday said they did n ' t see the shooting as a scandal , rather the act of a comrade who faced intense pressure during the effort to que ##ll the insurgency in the city .
" i can see why he would do it .
he was probably running around being shot at for days on end in fall ##uj ##a .
there should be an investigation but they should look into the circumstances , " said lance corporal christopher hanson .
" i would have shot the ins ##urgent too .
two shots to the head , " said sergeant nicholas graham , 24 , of pittsburgh , pennsylvania .
" you ca n ' t trust these people .
he should not be investigated .
he did nothing wrong .
" of course the anti - american world press is jumping all over this story , casually om ##itt ##ing the fact that just a day earlier the marine in question lost a fellow soldier who was attending to a dead ins ##urgent that was boo ##by - trapped with explosives .
add the tactic of boo ##by - trapping your own dead to the effective suicide bombings , and it ' s clear to say that the geneva convention is n ' t on the minds of the insurgents .
for that i believe the marines should handle dead and wounded insurgents by any means necessary to ensure their own safety and prevent a possible ambush .
i ' m no fan of this war either , but it ir ##ks me to no end reading and listening to civilian opinions on how soldiers should conduct themselves in hostile war zones from their comfortable rec ##liner ##s .
to the world press and everyone else who des ##pis ##es the united states : you do n ' t have to like our president or those operating this war , but get off the backs of the 18 , 19 and 20 year - olds thrown into a situation you will never see or have to encounter .
i ' ve got too many friends in iraq right now i want to see come home alive and well , and i will support them at every opportunity .

2004 - 11 - 17 ##t ##20 : 02 : 00 chris matthews , that idiot talking head over at ms ##nbc , said yesterday about the terrorists we fought in fall ##uj ##ah " a rival , i mean they ' re not bad guys especially , just people who just disagree with us " . . . .
this just ama ##zes me , the complete id ##io ##cy of this waste of human sperm .
these are the same terrorists blowing up families , chop ##ping off heads of civilians , and the complete disregard for any human life and they just disagree with us ?
tell that to the family of margaret hassan , the school teacher who was brutally tortured and then slaughtered by these same guys , they ai n ' t so bad are they chris matthews ?
this women who was known for her 30 years of work in iraq , distributing medicine , food and supplies to iraqi ##s suffering under the sanctions of the 1990s .
british officials say they believe hassan was a blind ##fold ##ed woman seen being shot in the head by a hooded militant on a video obtained but not aired by the arab television station al - ja ##zee ##ra .
she would be the first foreign woman to die in the wave of kidnapping ##s in iraq .
no group has claimed responsibility .
on sunday , marines found the mu ##tila ##ted body of what they believe was a western woman on a street in fall ##uj ##ah during the u . s . assault on the ins ##urgent stronghold .
the body , clothed in what appeared to be a purple , ve ##lou ##r dress , was wrapped in a blanket , with a blood - soaked black cloth nearby .
as of tuesday night , the u . s . command said the body had not been identified .
these are the reasons that none of these mother ##ef ##fers should ever see the light of day . . . they need to be all lined up and shot .
tor ##turing this poor women for what ?
what ?
and we should treat them as enemy soldiers under the geneva convention .
last i remember the convention applies to countries that signed the document and the two countries must have standing armies with uniforms . . . .
the iraqi military is at our side , the terrorists are not .
since when are terrorists soldiers ?
they are lower then dogs .
finally there is this written by a student of mrs . hassan she was my english teacher
in the memory of my teacher and a fellow aid worker colleague mrs . m . hassan
mrs . hassan was my english teacher in the british council in baghdad in al - wa ##zi ##rya district , i remember her years ago with her irish accent telling me it ' s not important how many words i must learn but the pronunciation of the words i already knew must be perfect ##ed .
mrs . hassan speak s perfect arabic and she has a heart of gold , she ' s been killed by ( men in pajamas ) , turn iraq upside down and find them . the marines will find them , and when they do they shall die .

liberal reporter taking kick ##backs
curt
2005 - 02 - 03 ##t ##19 : 53 : 00 interesting article at the accuracy in media website yesterday .
it seems a supposed straight shooting reporter with nbc was taking money to fund a book that is so pro - united nations that its almost sick ##ening to read .
( hat tip clear and present )
one of the hottest stories around , the u . n . corruption scandal , nbc has been out to lunch .
why ?
its u . n . reporter has been on the payroll of the u . n . lobby .
linda fa ##sul ##o , the u . n . correspondent for nbc news and ms ##nbc , has written a pro - u . n . book , an insider ' s guide to the u . n . , which reads like the u . n . paid for it .
actually , the pro - u . n . lobby paid for it .
in a monstrous conflict of interest for a supposed straight news reporter , fa ##sul ##o acknowledges ted turner ' s u . n . foundation and better world campaign for " their generous financial support " of her book project .
she also thanks the rockefeller brothers fund " for helping to fund the project . " the book is about " one of the finest and most important governing bodies , " she says .
of the u . n . chief , she writes like a school girl with a crush .
" it is hard to find anyone who can mount a serious criticism of [ ko ##fi ] anna ##n ' s performance as secretary general , " she claims .
his performance is so " impressive " that she wonders if a " cult of personality " has risen up around him .
one u . s . official is reported to be " astonished by just how good a secretary general ko ##fi anna ##n has been .
" yu ##p , you read that right .
ko ##fi ' s performance is soo ##oo ##oo impressive .
gag .
guess the democrats have their own armstrong conspiracy to deal with .
why would an nbc reporter ( who also reports on the u . n . for national public radio ) take money from the u . n . lobby ?
perhaps because longtime nbc news anchor tom bro ##ka ##w put his stamp of approval on the una - usa and bc ##un by acting as master of ceremonies at their 2001 global leadership dinner .
not surprisingly , bro ##ka ##w is listed on the fa ##sul ##o book jacket as saying it is a " must - read .
" another endorsement of the book comes from barbara cross ##ette , former new york times bureau chief at the u . n . who now writes for u . n . wire , a ted turner - funded online news service that covers the u . n . a fascinating part of the book is how fa ##sul ##o manages to gloss over anna ##n ' s role in the 1994 genocide in rwanda .
she tries to blame the u . s . and other members of the security council for not sending enough troops to stop it .
she admits , however , that , " the rwanda massacre ##s occurred while anna ##n was u . n . under ##se ##cre ##tary general for peacekeeping , " and that " after he became sg [ secretary general ] , anna ##n commissioned a report to examine what had happened and suggest re ##med ##ies . " later , " anna ##n accepted responsibility for failing to act more quickly , " she writes .
but responsibility for what ?
the truth is that , as director of u . n . peacekeeping , anna ##n personally refused requests to author ##ize u . n . peace ##keepers in rwanda to seize weapons and prevent genocide .
writer and author philip go ##ure ##vi ##tch has described in detail how , three months before the genocide , major general romeo dal ##lai ##re , the commander of several thousand u . n . troops in rwanda , sent a fa ##x to ko ##fi anna ##n ' s office , saying he had received evidence from a rwanda ##n government informant that genocide was being planned .
the informant offered to help u . n . forces in raiding the government stock ##pile ##s to be used in the genocide campaign .
all that the informant wanted in return was protection for himself and his family .
but the general needed u . n . authorization to conduct such a raid and save lives .
he asked for that approval but the answer came back in a now - infamous " genocide fa ##x " from anna ##n ' s office .
it denied authorization for the mission and told him that he should turn the information provided by the confidential witness over to the rwanda ##n government which was planning the genocide !
the result was that the information dried up and the genocide took place . yu ##p , good ole ko ##fi told this poor guy to give the secret info over to the very government that was planning the genocide .
what a great guy he is is n ' t he .
or how about the ongoing prostitution that ' s going on in the congo ?
now the report comes out today on the oil for food scandal . yeah . . . this guy is such a good sg .
e ##ff him .
the article ends with the following :
in an april 30 , 2001 , washington times column , nat hen ##to ##ff noted that the media have devoted " scan ##t mention " to the " plain fact that it was mr . anna ##n , when he was head of the united nation ' s peacekeeping office , who could have prevented the slaughter of 800 , 000 tu ##ts ##is and their sy ##mp ##athi ##zers in rwanda in 1994 .
" it ' s true , hen ##to ##ff said , that the u . n . issued a report in 1999 that acknowledged , to some extent , its role in the killings .
but for five and a half years , he noted , anna ##n " refused to accept any responsibility for the rwanda ##n holocaust until mr . go ##ure ##vi ##tch and others revealed that less than 5 , 000 u . n . troops could have stopped the killings if mr . anna ##n had not closed his eyes .
" it is astonishing that a journalist for nbc new would close her eyes to anna ##n ' s role .
but that is what she was apparently paid to do .

2005 - 02 - 23 ##t ##10 : 49 : 00 got job ?
and so , i have rejoined the world of the fully employed .
after christmas , i got a call from the wife of one of my former bosses ( at my last full - time job ) .
she was looking for a development assistant at the retirement community where she works .
i started here 4 weeks ago .
w ##m is affiliated with , but not run or fully supported by , the denomination i ' ve been a part of all my life ( um ##c ) .
my grandmother ( who was baptist ) lived here for a few months before she died in 1995 , so i have many connections to the job .
our offices are in one of the patio homes , and i have my own lovely office with a window .
the job ' s only about 12 miles from home , and i ' m going against the bulk of the traffic mornings and afternoons .
it all seems perfect and yet . . . oh , i ' m so thankful to be somewhere so nice where i might actually make a difference in people ' s lives , and i want to keep an open mind and hope it ' ll last forever , but i have a feeling i ' ll be restless within a year or so .
my boss is a very nice person , but conservative and resistant to technology , i . e . computers , internet , etc .
we just got new computers a week and half ago , and she ' s grip ##ing about xp ( her old os was windows 98 - - mine was 95 , so i ' m thrilled with the new stuff ) .
i tell her it ' ll just take some getting used to .
we ' ll see .
i ' m not making the kind of salary i was hoping to get , but it ' s the best salary i ' ve gotten thus far .
when i was full ##time in radio i made a little less , but i got quite a few remote ##s , which make up for not getting a top ##not ##ch salary .
i ' m still doing my tv announcing and my weekend radio stuff , so that money will help .
i ' m going to start actively pursuing more voice work in the next month or so , too .
my plan is to pay off my car early , and then work on the other debts .
i think it ' s time to go on and fill out the adoption applications .
i ' m terrified of more debt , but mom and dad will help with the money .
i ' m not sure they realize how expensive it all is .
i ' m thinking we might lean toward adopting from guatemala , but we ' ve still not hash ##ed it all out .
it ' s almost bad making some money now , because while most of me wants to save as much as possible , the other , smaller part is screaming loudly for stuff , stuff , stuff ! ! !
i ' ve got a trial subscription to x ##m at work because of the dell computers , and now i ' m lust ##ing to have it all of the time .
g got me a nice office stereo for my birthday and it does have an aux jack , so i could listen to it here .
he asked if i wanted a car stereo , and i said no , but i do .
there are so many things i want .
a garage .
a dining room set .
new stuff for our house .
new clothes .
new everything .
but i want family more .
i think part of the draw of the other stuff is i could get it now .
but i ' d be paying for it later .
money makes the world go round and round and round til i ' m just dizzy .

the appeals court ruled last summer , but the phrase under god which was ad de ##d to the pledge in the 1950s is an unconstitutional endorsement of religion . we ' ll continue to follow this court ruling as well .
here ' s how you ' re weighing in on our web question of the day . remember when we ' ve been asking you this question .
who is the number one threat facing the u . s . ?
is it saddam hussein , kim jong il or os ##ama bin laden ?
look at the results .
13 % % of you say saddam hussein .
14 % of you who voted say kim jong il , 41 % say os ##ama bin laden .
remember , this is not , not a 13 , 46 , 4 1 , those are the numbers .
you see them , 13 % for saddam hussein , 46 % for kim jong il , 41 % for os ##ama bin laden .
remember this , ask not a scientific poll ,

reporter : the fbi ' s interest in this state park in maryland dates back to last december .
officials got a tip back then that someone may have dumped equipment into one of the park ' s ponds .
officials say they found the tip significant because the pond is about ten miles from fort diet ##rick where the army experimented with ant ##hra ##x .
agents searched the area at least four times since then .

nor is there any evidence linking any individual to the deadly ant ##hra ##x led ##ders .
the fbi has said nothing publicly about anyone it may be investigating , but attorney general john ash ##croft did refer publicly to steven hatfield , a former researcher as a person of interest .
he ' s repeatedly proclaimed his innocence and the spokesman told cnn - -
well , the fbi can drain the pacific ocean but they wo n ' t find any evidence that he was involved with the attacks because he had nothing to do with the ant ##hra ##x attacks at all .

15 dead as suicide bomber blasts student bus , israel hits back in gaza
haifa , israel , march 5 ( af ##p ) - fifteen people were killed and more than 30 wounded wednesday as a suicide bomber blew himself up on a student bus in the northern town of haifa , the first bombing in israel in exactly two months .
several hours later , dozens of israeli tanks advanced into the northern gaza strip backed by helicopters which fired at least three rockets in the ja ##bal ##iya area , palestinian security sources said .
palestinian medical sources said 60 - year - old mohammed al - bi ##yar ##i was killed in his home near ja ##bal ##iya refugee camp by the rocket fire and another wounded .
a second rocket landed in farmland ##s and the other hit a house inside the refugee camp , but without causing further casualties , palestinian security sources said .
two 13 - year - old children were among those killed in the haifa bus bombing , israeli public radio said , adding that most of the victims were young ##sters .
the army said two soldiers were also among the dead .
the bus was ripped to sh ##red ##s while travelling between a residential area and haifa university .
of the 33 injured still in hospital late wednesday , two were in intensive care and six others in serious condition , the radio said .
israel ' s night - time raid in gaza involving around 40 tanks and armoured vehicles came after prime minister ariel sharon convened his security cabinet to discuss a response to the bomb attack .
israeli media said the retaliation was unlikely to be on a scale that would risk disrupt ##ing us preparations for war on iraq .
the palestinian suicide bomber on the haifa bus came from the southern west bank town of he ##bron , public radio said , naming him as 20 - year - old mahmoud ham ##adan salim q ##awa ##sm ##i .
apart from his id card , also found in the wreckage were the remains of a letter allegedly out ##lining his plan to carry out a suicide attack and praising the september 2001 destruction of the world trade centre in new york , it said .
israeli police were not immediately available for comment , but palestinian sources in he ##bron said mahmoud q ##awa ##sm ##i was a 21 - year - old student with links to the islamic radical group hamas .
israeli forces moved into he ##bron ' s al - sheikh district where his family lived and arrested q ##awa ##sm ##i ' s brother and father after the bombing , they said .
without claiming responsibility , hamas and another hard ##line group , islamic jihad , said the blast was revenge for a string of bloody israeli army raids into the gaza strip in recent weeks .
but the palestinian authority condemned the attack , saying it would divert international sympathy away from the far higher palestinian civilian death toll .
" we condemn all attacks against civilians including today ' s attack in haifa , " said information minister ya ##sser abe ##d ra ##bb ##o .
the palestinian leadership said the attack would serve as " a pre ##text for israel ' s government and occupation army to step up its deadly campaign which caused the deaths of 77 palestinians in february " .
it was the first bomb attack inside israel since january 5 , and came just days after the hawk ##ish sharon appointed the most right - wing government in israel ' s history on a pledge to get tough on security .
in the january attack , two palestinian suicide bombers blew themselves up in central tel aviv , killing 23 other people .
israeli government spokesman av ##i paz ##ner called the latest deadly blast a " very grave attack " and said the jewish state would take " vigorous action against the terrorist organisations " .
he told af ##p that israeli intelligence had been dealing with at least 40 tip - offs of impending attacks when the haifa bus was blown up .
us president george w . bush condemned the " attack on innocent ##s in israel , " white house spokesman ari fl ##eis ##cher said , adding that " his message to the terrorists is : their efforts will not be su ##cc ##ces ##sf ##ul .
" he will continue to pursue the path to peace in the middle east . "
eu foreign policy su ##pre ##mo javier sol ##ana likewise slammed the attack , although he also took a ja ##b at israel , saying , " there have been too many civilians killed in the last weeks and the last days . "
in london , a spokesman for the british prime minister said tony blair " condemn ##s absolutely what has happened " .
the spokesman added that he " would obviously call on all sides to do what they can to break the cycle of violence , because it is only through engagement that we can realise the vision everyone wants to see .
" there needs to be dialogue in order for this to be resolved . "
the bus attack came just two days after israeli forces staged a bloody raid into a refugee camp in central gaza targeting a founding member of hamas , which has spearheaded suicide bombings against the jewish state .
hamas vowed to continue its attacks , while the palestinian authority accused israel of trying to disrupt top - level palestinian meetings to discuss reforms of ara ##fat ' s administration .
palestinian chief ne ##go ##tia ##tor sa ##eb era ##kat said international intervention was needed to break the cycle of violence .
eight people , including a pregnant woman and a 13 - year - old child were killed in monday ' s gaza raid , pro ##voking us - led international calls for israeli restraint .
and on tuesday , israeli troops shot dead an elderly palestinian shepherd outside a jewish settlement on the edge of gaza city .
in the west bank , an eight - year - old palestinian boy as well as his brother and a sister were wounded late wednesday by israeli gunfire in a village north of the town of rama ##llah , their elder sister said .

so ##the ##by ' s , christie ' s pay 40 million dollars over anti ##trust suits
new york , march 11 ( af ##p )
the world ' s most powerful fine art auction houses , so ##the ##by ' s and christie ' s , have agreed to pay 40 million dollars to settle an international price - fixing sc ##am , so ##the ##by ' s said .
the payment , if approved by the courts , would settle a sl ##ew of suits by clients over auction ##s held between 1993 and 2000 outside the united states , it said in a statement .
" under the terms of the settlement agreement , so ##the ##by ' s and christie ' s will each pay 20 million dollars , " said so ##the ##by ' s , which operates in 34 countries .
the deal required threatened british and canadian claims against both auction houses to be dropped .
buyers and sellers also would have to agree not to pursue further cases in foreign courts .
the litigation covers buyers in auction ##s outside the united states between january 1 , 1993 and february 7 , 2000 , and sellers between september 1 , 1995 and february 7 , 2000 .
similar claims over us - based auction ##s were settled in an agreement struck in september 2000 for a total of 512 million dollars .
in december 2001 , a manhattan jury convicted so ##the ##by ' s main shareholder and former chairman alfred tau ##bm ##an of entering into a price - fixing agreement with christie ' s .
four months later , the billionaire was sentenced to one year in prison and a 7 . 5 - million - dollar fine over the price - fixing , which prosecutors said had cost clients of both firms 400 million dollars .
christie ' s was not prosecuted in the united states after its management agreed to testify against so ##the ##by ' s and provide documents needed to prove fraudulent intent .
together , so ##the ##by ' s and christie ' s control more than 90 percent of the fine art and antiques market .

stale ##mate at the security council ; washington warns it may bypass un = ( pictures + graphic ) =
united nations , march 14 ( af ##p )
efforts were to continue at the united nations friday to find a breakthrough in the diplomatic stale ##mate on iraq , with washington warning it could bypass the security council and go to war alone .
with marathon talks at the top world body failing late thursday to reconcile french and russian opposition to us - british war plans , the united states up ##ped its military presence , deploy ##ing more missile - firing warships to the red sea .
six non - permanent members of the security council considered to be in the middle ground between the fiercely pro - and anti - war camps , were working on new proposals to break the dead ##lock , france ' s ambassador to the un said .
" the six are now working on a paper and we will see the outcome of that consultation , maybe tomorrow ( friday ) " jean - marc de la sa ##bl ##iere told reporters .
iraq was due to present a 30 - page report on biological weapons it said it destroyed in 1991 , according to diplomatic sources in baghdad , who said a second batch of documents on ant ##hra ##x would follow in the next few days .
amid talk of delaying or even she ##lving a us - british resolution giving iraqi president saddam hussein until monday to di ##sar ##m or face war , oil prices in asia pulled back , shares rose and the us dollar eased .
british efforts to provide a way out of the diplomatic mir ##e at the united nations ended without agreement late thursday , but with london ' s ambassador to the un , jeremy greens ##tock , saying he expected talks to go on into the weekend .
his us counterpart , john negro ##pon ##te , said : " i ca n ' t say we are much farther along today than we were yesterday , " after hours of talks on six british bench ##marks to test iraq ' s compliance with council demands .
the tests were designed to sway six un ##com ##mit ##ted council members behind a draft resolution which would declare that iraq has missed its last chance to di ##sar ##m peacefully unless the council decides otherwise by monday .
the two allies would not push for a vote friday on the draft resolution , diplomats at the united nations said , while us secretary of state colin powell hinted that washington would consider not even putting the text to a vote .
" we are still talking to the members of the council with respect to coal ##es ##cing around a position that would n ' t draw a veto , but the options remain : go for a vote and see what members say , or not go for a vote , " powell said .
" we will be examining them today , tomorrow and into the weekend , " he said late thursday .
diplomatic wr ##ang ##ling has centred around the french and russian refusal to put their names to any resolution allowing the united states to un ##lea ##sh its military might against iraq before weapons inspections have run their course .
france has provoked washington ' s ir ##e in its ste ##ad ##fast insistence that it will veto any resolution paving the way for war , even rejecting the british proposals for concrete tests before baghdad had done so .
france ' s threat to cast its veto was only making war more likely , british foreign secretary jack straw said .
" unfortunately they appear to have made the decision not to enforce ( un resolution ) 144 ##1 , " straw told britain ' s the guardian newspaper . " that render ##s it less likely that we get a peaceful outcome . "
russian deputy foreign minister yu ##ry fed ##oto ##v said the us decision to drop demands for a security council vote this week on war with iraq showed the resolution had not won enough support .
he rejected the british proposals , saying : " the british proposals on iraq are not constructive and do not resolve the key problem , the prevention of a military scenario involving baghdad , " the inter ##fa ##x news agency reported .
he repeated that moscow would not back a resolution that authorised an attack against iraq : " it is not necessary now to adopt any new resolution on iraq , especially resolutions which lead to war . "
his comments were echoed by the german ambassador to the un , gunter pl ##eu ##ger , who said : " there is no majority support for the british proposal . "
in germany , chancellor gerhard sc ##hr ##oed ##er said that weapons inspectors had to be allowed to continue their work .
" together with our friends in france , with russia , china and the majority of the security council we are confident the di ##sar ##mament of iraq can be achieved through peaceful means , " sc ##hr ##oed ##er said .
the british - us proposal needs nine votes to pass through the 15 - member security council - - a feat looking increasingly unlikely with france and russia vow ##ing to veto the resolution and syria , china and germany all opposing .
the united states meanwhile deployed its b - 2 stealth bombers to positions closer to iraq and ordered as many as 15 warships capable of firing tom ##aha ##wk cruise missiles to the red sea from the mediterranean , us officials said .

barry dil ##ler resign ##s as ceo of vi ##ven ##di universal entertainment attention - adds details , background / / /
new york , march 19 ( af ##p )
media ty ##co ##on barry dil ##ler on wednesday quit as chief of vi ##ven ##di universal entertainment , the entertainment unit of french giant vi ##ven ##di universal whose future appears up for grabs .
in a statement , dil ##ler - - who took on the " provisional " role at the top of vi ##ven ##di ' s us entertainment operations in december - - said his usa interactive group will nonetheless remain a shareholder of vi ##ven ##di universal entertainment .
" my executive role was never intended to be permanent , " said dil ##ler . " now that vi ##ven ##di universal has begun a formal process in reviewing options for its entertainment assets , it is appropriate to step aside from any direct management responsibility .
"
as part of the 11 - billion - dollar sale of usa interactive ' s film and television operations to the french media company in december 2001 , usa interactive received 2 . 5 billion dollars in preferred shares in vi ##ven ##di universal entertainment .
dil ##ler , 60 , personally received a 1 . 5 percent stake in the business and had been to ##uted as a likely candidate to run vi ##ven ##di universal ' s entertainment unit in the united states if the troubled french media giant were broken up .
in paris , the french media group said parent company chairman jean - rene four ##tou will replace dil ##ler as chairman and chief executive of us unit .
vi ##ven ##di , in a statement , said that dil ##ler had , " in full agreement with vi ##ven ##di universal , " announced that he was " ending his temporary assignment as ceo of vi ##ven ##di universal entertainment . "
vi ##ven ##di universal , the world ' s second - largest media group after ao ##l time warner of the united states , has been digging out from under a mountain of debt since the removal of expansion ##ist boss jean - marie mess ##ier last july , largely through asset sales .
vi ##ven ##di universal earlier this month posted a record net loss of 23 . 3 billion euros ( 25 . 6 billion dollars ) for 2002 .
faced with debt of 35 billion euros ( 37 billion dollars ) in june last year - - including 19 billion from the media and telecom ##s division alone - - the sprawling conglomerate has set a target of reducing its debt by 16 billion euros by end - 2004 .
speculation has been ri ##fe that troubled vi ##ven ##di has been weighing a spin ##off or sale of its us film , television and theme park operations as part of its restructuring .
press speculation had already suggested that vi ##ven ##di might decide to keep its universal music division , while either dive ##sti ##ng or inviting third parties to take a minority stake in the remaining entertainment assets .
earlier this month , sources told age ##nce france press ##e financial news unit af ##x that via ##com is studying a bid for vi ##ven ##di ' s us entertainment assets placing it as a serious rival square ##ly in the running against oil billionaire marvin davis who has bid 20 billion dollars for the operations .
while other media companies like metro - gold ##wyn - mayer , liberty media corp , news corp and general electric co ' s nbc have been mentioned as potential bid ##ders for the vi ##ven ##di operations , via ##com is one of the few media companies with a balance sheet healthy enough to mount a bid .

thousands take to streets across mid ##ea ##st to protest war = ( pictures ) =
cairo , march 20 ( af ##p )
tens of thousands of people took to the streets across the middle east thursday , demonstrating against military strikes on iraq and calling on muslims to wage jihad against the united states and its allies .
lebanon and the palestinian authority issued fierce den ##unciation ##s of the us - led attacks , while the egyptian government daily al - ah ##ram warned it marked " the beginning an era of us colon ##isation that will benefit only israel " .
protests against the action aimed at top ##pling iraqi president saddam hussein were held in cities across libya , egypt and lebanon , as well as in amman , damascus and the gaza strip .
however , there were no reports of protests against the war from the gulf states , many of whom are host to us military personnel .
saudi arabia , however , expressed its " deep concern " and regret over the start of us military operations .
foreign minister prince sa ##ud al - fai ##sal spoke of the " kingdom ' s hope for a quick halt in military action and for the return to peaceful efforts " , the state spa news agency reported .
in ri ##yad ##h ' s first reaction to the start of the against , he also called for iraq ' s " unity , internal security and territorial integrity " to be preserved and rejected military occupation .
lebanese president emile la ##ho ##ud , meanwhile , was more forth ##right , strongly den ##oun ##cing washington ' s " aggression " and warning that it could have rep ##er ##cus ##sions beyond the borders of the par ##iah state .
" we have warned against the marginal ##isation of the united nations . . . and we see this aggression today plunging the world into a tunnel where one can not see the end , " he said in a statement .
" for these reasons , we judge that it is necessary that the forces of peace and those who believe in right and justice take the necessary and rapid steps to halt this dangerous slide into war against iraq which will result in heavy human and material losses . "
the palestinian authority also condemned thursday ' s early morning missile strikes on iraq , and warned israel not to exploit the conflict .
" we palestinians are against the war and we totally condemn this war in the middle east .
a solution must be found to this problem through diplomatic means , with the international community , " local authorities minister sa ##eb era ##kat said .
" we are warning israel not to exploit this war against iraq to carry out more attacks against the palestinian people in the gaza strip and destroy the palestinian authority and the peace process , " he said .
the radical palestinian movement islamic jihad warned that " the war against iraq is a war against the whole region " , while hamas issued a chilling warning against those taking part in the war against iraq .
" the aggression by the vile americans and the war against iraq signifies a war against all arabs and muslims around the world , " said hamas senior official abdul aziz al - ran ##tis ##si .
the war " shows the imp ##ote ##nce of all arab states .
we call on all arab states to act immediately to defend iraq and counter the us war , " he said .
" i do n ' t think america will win this war , as our jihad ( holy war ) and our resistance will teach the americans and british a lesson they will never forget , " he said .
state radio in syria accused the united states and its allies of wanting to get their " hands on iraq ' s oil and wealth and impose their he ##ge ##mony on the world " .
in the egyptian capital , 10 demonstrators and at least four policeman were injured in clashes after several thousand demonstrators took to the streets near the us and british em ##bas ##sies .
riot police intervened after the protest ##ors , who included hundreds of students from the american university in cairo , rallied on the city ' s central ta ##hri ##r square , close to both the university campus and the us embassy .
more than 1 , 000 people also gathered at cairo ' s al - az ##har islamic university , where they burned an american flag and demanded the expulsion of the ambassadors of the united states , britain , spain and israel .
demonstrations also took place in the northern egyptian cities of alexandria , tan ##ta and ka ##fr el - sheikh .
in amman , three protest ##ors were hospital ##ised after some 500 jordanian lawyers staged a sit - in at the main court house after being forcibly blocked by riot police from marching towards the iraqi embassy to show their solidarity .
in lebanon , hundreds of students gathered on the campuses of the arab university of beirut and the american university of beirut calling for the assassination of us president george w . bush and british prime minister tony blair .
south of the capital in sid ##on , some 1 , 500 school ##boys denounced " the bush assassin " and the " silence of the arab leaders who sold out iraq " .

indonesia delays execution of convicts including indian on death row
jakarta , march 27 ( af ##p )
indonesia will delay the execution of six convicts including an indian on death row after five of them appealed to the supreme court for a second review , prosecutors said thursday .
" if we execute them now we ca n ' t bring them to life again should their appeals for a review be granted , " said ant ##asa ##ri az ##har , spokesman for the attorney general ' s office .
the supreme court rejected earlier appeals for a case review from five of the convicts .
the sixth offender has only made one appeal for a review .
president mega ##wat ##i su ##kar ##no ##put ##ri has refused cl ##eme ##ncy for the six and asked for a speedy execution .
five of them are indonesian ##s convicted of murders while the other is an indian drug offender , a ##yo ##dh ##ya prasad cha ##ub ##ey .
" we are talking about someone ' s life or death so we have to be very careful , " az ##har said .
a convict can file a case review or appeal for presidential cl ##eme ##ncy only after the supreme court uphold ##s a sentence imposed by a lower court .
apart from those convicted of murder , 16 people are on death row for drug trafficking - - 11 foreigners , four indonesian ##s and a dutch citizen of chinese - indonesian origin .
indonesian courts have increasingly handed out severe sentences , including death , for drug smug ##glers .
narcotics abuse is an increasingly serious problem in the country .

more us troops to iraq as bush , blair hold war talks = ( pictures ) = attention - adds details / / /
washington , march 27 ( af ##p )
thousands of fresh us troops headed for iraq thursday as british prime minister tony blair and us president george w . bush discussed the effort to ou ##st saddam hussein , which some senior us military officials warn could last months .
about 1 , 000 soldiers from the us army ' s 173 ##rd airborne brigade parachute ##d into an airfield in a kurdish - controlled area of northern iraq , establishing a base through which to bring in more troops and tanks , pentagon officials said .
and some 12 , 000 soldiers from the us army ' s 4th infantry division , which was supposed to have gone into northern iraq through turkey , began flying out of fort hood , texas , thursday to the region , a military fort spoke ##sw ##oman told af ##p .
the soldiers are to meet up with ships transporting their equipment , which is arriving in kuwait from the mediterranean , where it had been id ##ling for weeks on navy ships awaiting turkey ' s decision .
the war in iraq could last months and require considerable us military reinforcements to assure a victory , the washington post reported thursday , quoting senior us military officials .
sands ##torm ##s , dangerously long supply lines and a rec ##al ##cit ##rant enemy " has led to a broad re ##asse ##ss ##ment by some top generals of us military expectations and timeline ##s , " the post reports .
" tell me how this ends , " one senior officer asked the post .
most us army commanders believe it is critical to pause the break ##neck advance towards baghdad to secure the supply lines and make sure weapons are opera ##ble and troops res ##up ##pl ##ied after days of powerful sands ##torm ##s and damage inflicted by iraqi attacks , the post reports .
the post also quoted central intelligence agency and pentagon intelligence analysts complaining that bush officials largely ignored their warning that iraqi irregular forces would use guerrilla tactics and offer significant resistance .
publicly us officials have insisted that the war is going according to plan , and the most advanced us forces are currently some 100 kilometers ( 60 miles ) outside of baghdad .
us secretary of defense donald rum ##sf ##eld dismissed worries that there were insufficient forces in the gulf region if the battle for baghdad goes wrong .
after briefing us senators on the war , rum ##sf ##eld told reporters that the number of forces " has been increasing and it will continue to do so until it is finished . "
meanwhile blair arrived in washington late wednesday for two days of talks with bush at the camp david presidential retreat .
talks were to focus on how to run a post - saddam iraq , with washington resisting a large united nations role .
blair faces an up ##hill battle to win bush over to giving the un oversight of a post - saddam administration , as washington officials are still angry at germany , russia , and especially france , over the failure to secure un security council approval for military action .
blair and bush were to hold a joint press conference at 1600 gm ##t thursday .
britain has deployed some 45 , 000 troops to fight with the more than 250 , 000 us soldiers lined up against iraqi troops .
bush gave a new , stronger warning that the war could become drawn out .
" as they approach baghdad , our fighting units are facing the most desperate elements of a doomed regime , " bush told cheering military personnel wednesday at the florida headquarters of central command , which is running the campaign .
" we can not predict the final day of the iraqi regime , but i can assure you - - and i assure the long - suffering people of iraq - - there will be a day of reckon ##ing for the iraqi regime , and that day is drawing near , " he said .
at the last minute , bush withdrew a phrase in his speech saying the campaign was " ahead of schedule .
" a senior administration official said the president had decided to be cautious .
bush pointedly paid tribute to the 48 - nation " coalition of the willing " - - particularly britain - - that is publicly backing the campaign .
separately , us secretary of state colin powell emphasized us determination to pursue the military campaign despite the diplomatic pressure washington faces at the united nations .
" we are interested in concluding this conflict , not having a pause right now or stopping right now , but concluding this as quickly as possible so we can get on with the rebuilding of iraq and putting in place a better system of governance , " powell said in an interview with the al - ja ##zee ##ra arab television network .
powell , the most moderate member of the bush cabinet , said he fully agreed with the president ' s policy on iraq and had no plans to leave .
" personally , i ' m very much in sync with the president and he values my services , " he said in an interview with national public radio .
meanwhile the wall street journal reported that several british and us oil companies have quietly advised us and british forces on how oil fields operate so they could safeguard the fields in iraq .
the companies , including britain ' s bp plc and the texas - based boots and co ##ots international well control inc . , were not paid for their consultation ##s , but allied military engineers said their advice was critical .
