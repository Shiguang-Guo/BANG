russia hints " peace camp " alliance with germany and france is dying by dmitry za ##ks
moscow , april 13 ( af ##p )
russian president vladimir putin ' s summit with the leaders of germany and france may have been a failure that proves there can be no long - term " peace camp " alliance following the end of war in iraq , government sources were quoted as saying at the weekend .
" senior government officials , speaking in the corridors of power in moscow , have no illusions about any long - term perspectives for the ( russian - german - french ) axis , " the respected i ##z ##ves ##tia daily reported .
" sooner or later iraq will fall and russia and the united sat ##es will resume normal relations , " the senior moscow official , who was reported to be close to putin , told the paper .
" the situation in iraq does not mean that we intend to get into an argument with the united states . "
the comments indicate that russia ' s nu ##ance ##d position over the war in iraq was becoming ever more scrambled , with putin pushing to protect his bud ##ding friendship with us president george w . bush in the face of stride ##nt opposition from the russian media and other top k ##rem ##lin officials .
analysts have long argued that putin is far keen ##er to preserve friendly relations with the united states than the pro - european , anti - war camps embedded in much of the russian media and the foreign and defense ministries .
russia ' s foreign minister expressed outrage at suggestions from a top washington official last week that moscow should forgive the eight billion dollars in soviet - era debt that baghdad owes it , as a gesture of good will .
ko ##mmer ##sant business daily joined in , declaring in a furious front - page headline : " the united states is demanding that russia , france and germany pay for the iraqi war . "
and the popular gaze ##ta . ru news website stormed : " we should have expected this ! . .
this is only the start of a massive us campaign ( to decide iraq ' s future finances ) . "
yet putin has been far more reserved .
he and his loyal finance minister suggested friday that moscow might be prepared to wai ##ver some of the iraqi debts in return for better russia - us relations .
" on the whole the proposal is understand ##able and legitimate , " putin said .
" russia has no objections to such a proposal . "
putin concluded his two days of talks in saint petersburg with jacques chi ##rac of france and german chancellor gerhard sc ##hr ##oed ##er on saturday still urging for a central role for the united nations in a post - war revival of iraq .
the call reflected the insistent demand made by the three leaders before the us - british invasion of iraq that un approval was essential for any mission to top ##ple iraqi president saddam hussein .
but the saint petersburg summit ended without any formal declaration on iraq .
and diplomats noted that putin appeared uncomfortable at being so closely associated with the anti - washington stance of sc ##hr ##oed ##er and chi ##rac amid his developing friendship with bush .
putin had even secretly invited british prime minister tony blair , bush ' s staunch ##est back ##er in the war on iraq , to attend the pow - wow in saint petersburg ' s grand hotel europe , although diplomats said blair turned the offer down .
it remains to be seen how successful putin ' s overture ##s to washington will be in the face of the fe ##r ##vent internal hostility to the us war stance .
a senior law ##maker seen as close to the k ##rem ##lin rid ##ic ##uled the united states sunday for failing to find any weapons of mass destruction in iraq .
" we do not think that america won , " said dmitry ro ##go ##zin , the head of the lower house of parliament ' s foreign affairs committee , told rossi ##a television .
" where are those chemical weapons ? " he demanded .
and putin ' s media aide , sergei ya ##st ##rz ##hem ##bs ##ky , told ko ##mmer ##sant russia would not forgive the iraqi debt .
" ( washington ) should not be so generous at other people ' s expense , " he said .

russia mis ##play ##ed iraq hand , but damage to us relations not fatal : analysts by dmitry za ##ks
moscow , april 17 ( af ##p )
silence is golden - - especially when your hand is weak - - top moscow policy analysts said in an assessment of the fallout from russia ' s vocal opposition to what turned out to be a swift us - led campaign in iraq .
several top diplomacy experts told a k ##rem ##lin - run forum that countries like china and india that said little about the conflict before its march 20 launch were already re ##ap ##ing the benefits .
some suggested that russian president vladimir putin will now be scrambling to contain the damage to his once - bud ##ding friendship with us president george w . bush because he was poorly advised by his intelligence and defense aide ##s .
one analyst said china - - which like russia and france wi ##eld ##s a un security council veto but never threatened to use it to prevent the war - - recently won its role as chief media ##tor between the united states and north korea because other regional powers ' confidence in russia fell as a result of its iraqi diplomacy .
" we are losing our positions in asia because . . . this failure of a strategic triangle that ( foreign minister igor ) ivanov invented with germany and france , " fu ##med andrei pi ##ont ##kovsky of moscow ' s center of strategic studies .
negotiations between washington and p ##yon ##gy ##ang on their nuclear dispute have been set for april 23 in be ##jing and are widely seen here as a blow to moscow efforts to stamp authority on the region by organizing such a meeting .
meanwhile the european " peace camp " tr ##oi ##ka finds itself in tricky diplomatic isolation from washington .
french president jacques chi ##rac received only a reserved response when he tried to men ##d fences by placing a telephone call tuesday to bush .
meanwhile german chancellor gerhard sc ##hr ##oed ##er has not spoken to bush since several weeks before the start of the war .
but not everyone here agreed that moscow ' s diplomatic relations with washington had suffered as badly .
most agreed that russian diplomacy mis ##cal ##cula ##ted and urged putin to quickly re ##asse ##ss the quality of his advisers .
" our analysis of foreign policy is lacking and often rev ##ert ##s to cold war stereotypes , " said former deputy foreign minister ana ##to ##ly adam ##ish ##in .
" we were so proud of forming an anti ##war bloc with france and germany - - but nations have not been forming such bloc ##s for at least 12 years and someone in moscow should have understood that it was impossible to ave ##rt this war . "
" our main goal now is to make sure that our relations with the united states do not suffer further - - and i think this is possible . "
us diplomats have hinted in recent weeks that washington ' s anger with european resistance to the campaign was focused more on paris - - and to a lesser extent berlin - - than it was with moscow .
putin last spoke to bush on april 5 at the us president ' s own initiative .
they are scheduled to meet next in the russian leader ' s native city of saint petersburg in late may .
" we lost nothing and won nothing - - this was not our war , " said liberal law ##maker irina k ##hak ##ama ##da of the union of right ##ist forces .
" we showed the americans that we would not give up on our position in iraq cheap ##ly and we did not .
we should continue sticking to our principles .
"
k ##hak ##ama ##da argued that the united states would also need russia ' s help " to make the new iraqi government seem legitimate . "
most analysts linked russia ' s opposition to a war in iraq to fears that it will lose oil contracts that were sealed with the now - toppled regime of saddam hussein .
the flood ##gate ##s of iraqi oil are also now likely to open to world markets and hurt russia ' s budget revenues - - which are heavily re ##lian ##t on revenues from its own energy exports .
but few at the k ##rem ##lin forum suggested that putin ' s own standing among voters will be hurt by russia ' s apparent diplomacy failures .
putin will face re - election in march 2004 and analysts noted that the war - - while opposed by most russians - - was never turned by the k ##rem ##lin into a matter of national security .
" i do not think that this will affect the elections unless russia ' s failure in iraq is presented as an issue of national security - - and has not been yet , " said viktor ku ##val ##din of a research center funded by former soviet president mikhail go ##rba ##chev .

north korea nuclear bombs ##hell sparks alarm , appeals for calm by charles w ##hel ##an = ( picture , graphic ) =
seoul , april 25 ( af ##p )
us allegations that north korea admitted to possessing nuclear weapons triggered alarm across asia friday and prompted appeals for calm from world capitals .
the admission , according to us sources , came during three - day talks in beijing which concluded friday , the first meeting between us and north korean officials since the nuclear crisis erupted six months ago .
china expressed hopes that both sides would keep the dialogue alive while officials in moscow and london called for patience in resolving the complex imp ##asse .
south korea and japan were cautious , with seoul foreign minister yoon young - kwan saying if the north koreans were telling the truth , it would represent a " major " threat to peace in northeast asia .
us sources with authoritative knowledge of the beijing meetings said the head of the north korean delegation li gun had confirmed to us envoy james kelly that the stalin ##ist state had developed nuclear weapons and hinted it may sell or use them , depending on us actions .
" they said what we always knew , that they do have weapons , " one us source said .
" that does n ' t shock us , we have been saying it .
now they have said it . "
li also told kelly that north korea had gone ahead with rep ##ro ##ces ##sing 8 , 000 spent fuel rods at its yong ##by ##on plant , which could produce enough weapons grade pluto ##nium for several more nuclear bombs , said the sources who requested an ##ony ##mity .
an angry us president george w . bush accused p ##yon ##gy ##ang of rev ##ert ##ing to blackmail following the nuclear admission and north korea fired back with a charge that washington had rejected a " bold " plan to resolve the six - month - old imp ##asse .
the outcome of the talks plunged financial markets into free ##fall in seoul with analysts saying they saw no sign of a recovery any time soon .
despite the leaked details about the meetings , us officials publicly declined to confirm any of north korea ' s announcements , with us state department spokesman richard bo ##ucher saying comments made by north koreans " require careful analysis . "
china , playing host to the talks , tried to put a positive spin on the talks which foreign minister li zhao ##xing said sign ##ified " a good beginning . "
" we hope that all sides can continue to make efforts to peacefully resolve the korean nuclear issue , " li was quoted by the official xi ##nh ##ua news agency as saying .
he said korean nuclear issue was " very complicated and sensitive , " but the key was to " not mind the other side ' s rhetoric , " but " pay attention to its actions . "
a top russian foreign ministry official called for patience and britain ' s foreign secretary jack straw echoed the call in a bbc radio interview .
kelly , the us assistant secretary for east asia and pacific affairs , arrived in seoul from beijing friday to brief yoon , the foreign minister .
" if it is true that north korea possesses nuclear weapons , this would be a major breach of peace on the korean peninsula as well as in northeast asia , " said yoon .
kelly , who declined to talks to reporters here , travels to tokyo sunday for talks with japanese officials .
he has made no public comments so far on the beijing talks .
however us secretary of state colin powell said the talks had featured " strong views " on all sides and insisted that the united states would not bow to blackmail , threats or " bell ##ico ##se statements . "
north korea , in its first official comment on the outcome of the talks , accused washington of ruling out p ##yon ##gy ##ang ' s " bold " plan for peace while offering nothing new itself .
a north korean foreign ministry spokesman , quoted by the official korean central news agency , made no reference to the reports that north korea had admitted to possessing nuclear weapons .
" at the talks the d ##pr ##k ( north korea ) set forth a new bold proposal to clear up bilateral concerns of the d ##pr ##k and the us , and the parties concerned with the nuclear issue on the korean peninsula , at the same time , " the unnamed official was quoted as saying .
" the us , however , repeated its old assertion that the d ##pr ##k should ' scrap its nuclear program before dialogue ' without advancing any new proposal at the talks . "
the official did not disclose what north korea ' s bold plan was .

pakistani christian gets life imprisonment for b ##las ##ph ##emy
mu ##lta ##n , pakistan , april 27 ( af ##p )
a pakistani court in central punjab province has sentenced a christian man to life imprisonment for a b ##las ##ph ##emy conviction , police said sunday .
judge shah ##id raf ##iq , of the district court in the industrial city of fai ##sal ##abad , found ran ##j ##ha mas ##ih guilty of def ##iling ko ##rani ##c verses during a protest rally by the minority christian community in 1998 .
in a verdict handed down on saturday , the judge also ordered ran ##j ##ha to pay a fine of 50 , 000 ru ##pee ##s ( about 870 us dollars ) , they said .
ran ##j ##ha was accused of tearing down a billboard carrying verses from the ko ##ran in fai ##sal ##abad during a christian demonstration after the city ' s bishop committed suicide over the 1985 b ##las ##ph ##emy law .
fai ##sal ##abad ' s catholic bishop john joseph , who had been campaigning against the law , shot himself in the head outside a court in sa ##hi ##wal district when the judge convicted christian a ##yu ##b mas ##ih under the law in 1998 .
a ##yu ##b mas ##ih was charged in 1996 with b ##las ##ph ##emy for allegedly defending british author salman rush ##die , whose novel " the satan ##ic verses " in ##fur ##iated radical mu ##ls ##im cleric ##s who accused the author of def ##ami ##ng islam .

nk ##ore ##a offers to scrap nu ##ke , missile programs but wants big concessions : us
by matthew lee
attention - updates / / /
washington , april 28 ( af ##p ) - north korea has offered to scrap its nuclear weapons and missile programs , but only in return for " considerable " diplomatic , political and economic concessions , the united states said monday .
secretary of state colin powell said the offer was made during three - way talks between us , north korean and chinese diplomats last week in beijing .
at the same meeting p ##yon ##gy ##ang confirmed it had nuclear weapons , and threatened to prove it with a " display . "
" the north koreans acknowledged a number of things that they were doing and , in effect , said that these are now up for further discussion , " he told reporters at the state department .
" they did put forward a plan that would ultimately deal with their nuclear capability and their missile activities , but they , of course , expect something considerable in return , " powell said .
" we are studying that plan , we are examining it with our friends and allies , " powell said , adding that talks were now underway with the south korean , japanese , russian and australian as well as other governments .
" it was useful to get it all out on the table and see where we go from here , " he said , referring to the april 23 to 25 discussions in beijing .
powell gave no indication as to whether washington would accept the offer , and did not address what p ##yon ##gy ##ang was demanding in terms of con ##ces ##ssion ##s .
however other us officials said the north koreans had presented a lengthy list of demands .
the demands include full normal ##ization of ties with the united states , security guarantees and economic assistance that include oil and other energy considerations .
" they had quite a list of things , " state department spokesman richard bo ##ucher told reporters .
asked specifically about normal ##ization of relations and economic assistance , bo ##ucher replied : " i do n ' t really qui ##bble with that characterization of the list . "
a senior state department official said later that the list of demands was so extensive that it def ##ied a " con ##cise description .
"
" it basically listed everything they have ever asked for , " the official told reporters on condition of an ##ony ##mity , identifying oil and energy supplies as demands .
although the north korean demands are being looked at , bo ##ucher repeated long - standing us policy that washington would not be blackmail ##ed or otherwise threatened into buying p ##yon ##gy ##ang off .
" we ' ve made clear we ' re not going to pay for elimination of the nuclear weapons programs that never should have begun in the first place , " he said .
powell acknowledged that north korea had hinted it could prove it possessed nuclear weapons with some sort of display during the beijing talks , but maintained that the north koreans had not used the words " test " or " testing . "
" they said that it is the kind of capability that one can display in one way or another , " he said .
the concessions demanded by p ##yon ##gy ##ang were part of a " bold " proposal for addressing the nuclear situation on the korean peninsula that north korea presented in beijing , officials said .
south korean newspapers reported earlier monday that the north suggested that p ##yon ##gy ##ang and washington act simultaneously and equally to resolve the six - month - old nuclear crisis .
bo ##ucher ruled out simultaneous steps by both sides , stress ##ing that washington would not consider such moves until the " ve ##ri ##fia ##ble and ir ##re ##vers ##ible termination " of the north ' s nuclear programs .
" we ( have ) made clear that once north korea did that , we could move on or move back to the comprehensive approach to us - north korea relations that we had talked about before , " he said .
south korea ' s mu ##nh ##wa il ##bo newspapers and others quoted unnamed south korean government sources as saying p ##yon ##gy ##ang also urged washington not to hind ##er its efforts to establish and improve ties with seoul and tokyo .
the north ' s ruling workers party newspaper , rod ##ong sin ##mun , indicated sunday that north korea wanted economic and political " rewards " from the united states in return for the elimination of its nuclear program .
rod ##ong called for a " fair and equal " footing in talks with the united states , blasting washington for insisting that there would be " no security of the system nor provision of rewards " even if p ##yon ##gy ##ang gave up its nuclear program .
it insisted north korea could do " everything " to defend itself if the united states " legally guarantees no use of arms including nu ##kes " .

south korea ' s ruling party faces call for dissolution
seoul , april 29 ( af ##p )
south korea ' s ruling party is facing an internal reform ##ist call for di ##sso ##lving itself to create a new group after a humiliating defeat at last week ' s by - elections , party officials said tuesday .
the ruling millennium democratic party ( md ##p ) , founded by former president kim da ##e - jung , has suffered declining popularity since president ro ##h mo ##o - hyun took office in february .
a group of 18 reform ##ist md ##p law ##makers , mostly ro ##h ' s con ##fi ##dant ##s , demanded late wednesday that the party be " constructive ##ly dissolved " to create a new grouping , md ##p officials said .
but the established md ##p leadership has opposed the sudden overhaul , they added .
reform ##ist md ##p members , however , vowed to launch a preparatory committee next month and to make " tangible progress " in the process of for ##ging a new party .
the internal dispute erupted after the md ##p lost three parliamentary seats in thursday ' s by - elections .
the opposition grand national party ( g ##np ) took two of the national assembly seats while a splinter reform ##ist party got the third .
with the latest wins , the g ##np increased its majority in the 272 - seat national assembly to 153 seats against 101 for the md ##p .
general elections are due in april next year .

australia ' s first listed bo ##rde ##llo plans sex disneyland
sydney , april 30 ( af ##p )
the daily planet ltd , about to become the first brothel to list on the australian stock exchange , plans to follow up its may day launching by opening a " sex disneyland " here , the melbourne - based bo ##rde ##llo announced wednesday .
chief executive andrew harris said the company was likely to abandon plans to acquire a hotel in sydney ' s kings cross red light district and acquire another property three times the size in a better location .
the daily planet raised 3 . 5 million dollars ( 2 . 2 million us ) in its initial public offering with one of the new 600 shareholders acquiring 1 . 0 million dollars worth of shares .
renowned hollywood madam heidi fl ##eis ##s has been flown to melbourne as guest of honour at thursday ' s market debut and , according to harris , has already played a key role in attracting worldwide media attention to the event .
" heidi ' s ideas , her background , her knowledge have helped us a great deal , " he said .
" the international novelty value with heidi promoting it has been massive - - these shares can go anywhere . "
but it has n ' t been an easy road to the australian stock exchange since the idea was first mo ##oted in 1994 .
" the establishment did not want a brothel on the stock exchange , " harris said .
" it ' s only because we were the biggest and the best that we could afford to do it .
" we have fought every institution , every law firm . . . it ' s cost us a fortune but now we ' re going on a massive expansion . "
harris said sydney was a more attractive option for the sex disneyland because its prostitution laws are less restrictive than melbourne ' s .
" prostitution is completely dec ##rim ##inal ##ised in sydney and we are going to build a monster , " he said .
" we want a complete one - stop adult venue - - we want a complete adult venue with adult cinemas , adult shops . . . we have found much bigger premises in a much better location to create a sex disneyland . "
the company is also considering fran ##chi ##sing the daily planet within australia with likely venues in perth , brisbane , sydney ' s western suburbs and a second venue in melbourne .
but the daily planet is saving its big plans for the united states where it is negotiating with two well - known us personalities to join the board .
" the united states is our major thrust , " he said .
" we want to build a little city called metropolis with a 150 - 200 room hotel in nevada . "

troubled french media group vi ##ven ##di set to sell theme parks : report
los angeles , may 2 ( af ##p )
bel ##ea ##gue ##red french media group vi ##ven ##di universal is in advanced negotiations to sell its theme park business to a us firm for around 1 . 5 billion dollars , the los angeles times said friday .
the report came as the ind ##eb ##ted group said it was planning to sell off its us unit vi ##ven ##di universal entertainment and other assets , to focus on its telecom ##s activities and its french cable television business .
the times said vi ##ven ##di universal was negotiating to sell its flagship theme parks to new york investment firm blacks ##tone group as a the first step toward di ##sman ##tling its entertainment empire .
vi ##ven ##di universal officials in the united states were not immediately available for comment on friday .
under the reported plans , blacks ##tone group would buy vi ##ven ##di ' s theme park division , including universal studios hollywood , universal orlando in florida and universal ' s ownership interests in parks in spain and japan , a source close to the negotiations told the paper .
blacks ##tone already holds a 50 percent stake in the two parks that make up universal orlando .
vi ##ven ##di earlier this week confirmed months of press speculation that it planned to shed its entertainment assets by the end of the year , including its famed universal movie studio and television assets .

budget cinema launched by east ##jet founder finally gets some films
london , may 9 ( af ##p )
a ground - breaking british budget cinema chain launched by the founder of low - cost airline easy ##jet announced friday that it had finally acquired some films to show - - just a fort ##night before it first opens .
easy ##cine ##ma , which aims to sell tickets to its no - fr ##ill ##s cinemas for as little as 20 pen ##ce ( 0 . 28 euros , 0 . 32 dollars ) , has been locked in a bitter battle with film distributors over how it wants to pay for titles .
rather than splitting ticket sales with distributors , easy ##cine ##ma wants to pay a fixed fee for rights to show first - run movies over a fixed period , a proposal thus far rejected by the film majors .
easy ##cine ##ma founder ste ##lio ##s haji - io ##ann ##ou , who set up easy ##jet in 1995 and built it up into europe ' s biggest budget airline , has vowed to take legal action against the distribution firms unless they allow him access .
the dead ##lock , and subsequent lack of any films , has been threatening to de - rail the debut of easy ##cine ##ma ' s first outlet in milton keynes , just north of london , which is due to open its doors on may 23 .
however the firm announced on friday that it had reached a deal with the british arm of french distributors path ##e to show four releases .
while not the latest hollywood blockbuster ##s , these include titles such as as recently - released us martial arts picture " bullet ##proof monk " and new british 1930s - based weep ##ie " the heart of me " .
haji - io ##ann ##ou prof ##essed himself " delighted " , but promised to push ahead in his battle with other distributors .
" the situation with the top six uk distributors representing more than 90 percent of the market is still in a dead ##lock , " he said .
" i have instructed my lawyers to discuss this issue with the office of fair trading . "
easy ##cine ##ma aims to make its money by drawing the public in with rock - bottom prices during off - peak hours , when traditional cinemas are often almost empty , also giving the biggest discount ##s to tickets bought long in advance .
to cut costs , all booking is done via the internet and the par ##ed - down cinemas have no popcorn stalls and skeleton staff .

mc ##i to pay huge fine to sec for accounting fraud : report
washington , may 19 ( af ##p )
mc ##i , formerly world ##com , and the securities and exchange commission have reached a final agreement in the telecom giant ' s 11 - billion - dollar ( 9 . 4 - billion - euro ) fraud case , the wall street journal reported monday .
under terms of the agreement , to be submitted as early as monday to a judge presiding over the case , mc ##i would agree to pay the largest fine imposed so far by the sec on a company that is not a broker - dealer , the journal said , citing sources close to the matter .
the report did not give the amount of the fine , but said it would be " exponential ##ly larger " than the historic 10 million dollars x ##ero ##x paid the sec last year .
last month , the sec slapped fines totaling 1 . 4 billion dollars on 10 wall street broker ##ages to settle charges of conflicts of interest between analysts and investors .
mc ##i and the sec negotiated the agreement for months after a partial settlement in november under which mc ##i , formerly known as world ##com , agreed not to mis ##lea ##d investors about its finances , and to improve internal controls , the journal said .
the estimated value of the fraud has reached historic proportions , swelling from the initially announced 3 . 5 million dollars to 11 million dollars as revelations of misconduct piled on , the report said .
separately , former world ##com ceo bernard e ##bber ##s failed on april 29 to make a first repay ##ment of 25 million dollars , plus interest , on a 400 - million - dollar loan from mc ##i , the journal said , citing sec documents .
because he is now in default mc ##i must now seize additional assets owned by e ##bber ##s , to secure the loan .
the company has already sold his georgia - based yacht building business for 15 million dollars , and is close to selling his ranch in british colombia , which is expected to bring 60 to 70 million dollars , the journal said .

shi ##ites openly mark mohammed ' s birthday in iraq as law ##lessness still reigns = ( pictures ) =
baghdad , may 19 ( af ##p )
shi ##ite muslims in iraq monday celebrated openly for the first time in decades prophet mohammed ' s birthday , as continuing anarchy and chaos threatened to undermine us efforts to rebuild the war - ravaged country .
meanwhile coalition officials in iraq insisted plans for an iraqi government were still on track and russia hinted that a compromise could be imminent on a un draft resolution to lift economic sanctions on iraq .
thousands of iraq ' s majority shi ##ite muslims marched to their main mosque in baghdad to mark the birthday of islam ' s founder prophet mohammed .
shi ##ites , who celebrate the birthday a week later than sunni muslims , were forbidden to publicly mark the date under the regime of saddam hussein ' s sunni - dominated regime .
the crowd filled the street leading to the ka ##zi ##miya mosque in the northeast of baghdad and carried banners in the green color of islam , calling for good government .
" no to injustice , " " no to occupation , " " no to israel , " " yes to islam , " chant ##ed the demonstrators as speeches began from a platform .
imam mohammad al - far ##tus ##si , who last week threatened violence against " sin ##ful " women , alcohol vendors and cinemas showing " ind ##ece ##nt " films , offered praise for the fall of saddam and called iraq " the land of imam ##s . . . land of islam . "
the demonstration came as iraq ' s top us oversee ##r paul br ##eme ##r began his second week on the job amid continuing law ##lessness in the country .
in his fr ##en ##zie ##d first seven days , the tel ##ege ##nic br ##eme ##r repeatedly promised to restore the law and order that cr ##umble ##d along with saddam hussein ' s regime nearly six weeks ago .
but despite issuing a host of tough decrees , br ##eme ##r has failed to stem the rampant crime and street violence pl ##ag ##uing the country .
despite a security crack ##down over the weekend in baghdad and an announcement that some 7 , 000 policemen had returned to their jobs since the end of the war , ordinary iraqi ##s still felt unsafe on the street with gunfire ri ##fe and police a near invisible presence .
in baghdad , almost all the police stations have been destroyed or looted since us troops took control of the capital on april 9 .
only two have so far reopened , and they have no equipment whatsoever . baghdad ' s top police job remains vacant .
and a trip to baghdad ' s lo ##ote ##r market only bears witness to the fact that criminals are ruling the ro ##ost in the post - saddam era .
packed with the piles of stolen goods picked up during the frenzy of theft that followed the collapse of saddam ' s regime , the traders deal in everything from computers and stereo ##s to furniture and weapons .
ja ##lal jam ##il , a 45 - year - old jewellery store owner , said the situation just keeps getting worse . " the americans encourage people to steal because when looting happens right under their noses they do nothing , " he said .
br ##eme ##r has also been criticized for backing away from an earlier us timeline on forming a government in iraq , but us - led coalition officials monday insisted government plans were still on track .
" we want to have an iraqi voice in everything we do here but it would be wrong to do that pre ##ci ##pit ##ously , " said a source at the organisation of reconstruction and humanitarian assistance ( or ##ha ) , which is administering post - war iraq .
officials from iraqi groups that met with br ##eme ##r last week have said that he back pe ##ddled on what they said were earlier pledge ##s to give them a lead role in forming a new interim government in the next few weeks .
" we understand that they want to have as much power as possible but we told them : ' you wo n ' t be directly elected , you wo n ' t have any direct experience of government , " the source said .
" ' of course you will have input into the government but , since you are not directly elected , it would be a nonsense for you to have direct executive power , ' the source said .
" the last thing we want is to leave a bunch of self - appointed ol ##iga ##rch ##s in power , " the source said .
the comments came on the same day that a prominent iraqi called for internationally - supervised elections in iraq .
ad ##nan pac ##ha ##chi , a one ##time foreign minister who returned to iraq on may 6 after 33 years in exile , told the independent az - za ##man daily that elections should be held under international supervision .
an interim government should create an election code and laws to clear the way for direct elections to a constituent assembly , that would draw up a constitution , pac ##ha ##chi said .
a referendum on the constitution would lead to elections for a new government , the 80 - year - old pac ##ha ##chi told the daily .
on the diplomatic front , a top russian official said monday that the un security council would likely vote this week on a us - british draft resolution to lift economic sanctions placed on iraq in 1990 after its invasion of kuwait and to place its oil riches under coalition control for at least a year .
" an updated text of the document may already be published today and may be put to a vote this week , " deputy foreign minister yu ##ry fed ##oto ##v told it ##ar - ta ##ss news agency .
yet fed ##oto ##v did not say whether russia would back the resolution , which diplomats have been rev ##ising since the united states , britain and spain first submitted it more than a week ago .
russia " will vote depending on what the resolution text turns out to be , " he said .
with billions of dollars in oil and debt interests in iraq , russia has been anxious to secure un involvement before supporting the resolution .
australia announced the creation monday of an expert panel to help iraq protect its rich cultural heritage and assist inter ##pol in recovering looted ancient artefacts .

chinese leader favour ##s russia in first foreign tour by henry meyer
moscow , may 23 ( af ##p )
highlighting close ties between moscow and beijing , chinese president hu jin ##tao monday will make russia his first foreign destination since becoming leader in a visit that could seal a major pipeline accord .
hu , who was appointed to the top job in march , will meet his russian counterpart vladimir putin during his three - day state visit from may 26 to 28 .
he will then stay on for a regional summit before heading to saint petersburg for celebrations marking the 300 ##th anniversary of the city ' s founding .
" this upcoming visit to russia will be my first trip aboard since i became president of china .
i plan a thorough exchange of views with president vladimir putin on bilateral and important regional and international issues , " hu said in an interview with russia ' s inter ##fa ##x news agency .
" our discussions should strengthen political trust between the two sides and mutually beneficial cooperation to raise russian - chinese relations to a new level , " he added .
putin , who enjoyed a warm relationship with former chinese president jiang ze ##ming , has made efforts to nur ##ture ties with hu and was the first world leader to go to beijing to meet him in december when he was president - in - waiting .
" presidents vladimir putin and hu jin ##tao have developed good personal contacts , which will undoubtedly facilitate the promotion of the russian strategic partnership , " russia ' s ambassador to china igor ro ##ga ##chy ##ov said , quoted by inter ##fa ##x .
russia has given a high priority to its relations with the united states despite a bitter disagreement over the us - led campaign to top ##ple saddam hussein in iraq .
but china remains a key russian ally , demonstrated by the fact that hu will be the only foreign leader apart from us president george w . bush to hold a summit with putin in the days surrounding the saint petersburg festivities .
leaders of the two asian giants , according to u ##f ##g financial broker ##age , may ink a deal for the construction of a 2 , 400 kilometre ( 1 , 500 - mile ) oil pipeline from eastern siberia to the chinese city of da ##qing , bringing russian crude to energy - hungry china .
although the russian government is formally committed to building an extension of the pipeline that would supply japan through the russian port of nak ##ho ##d ##ka , experts believe that project is unlikely to see the light of day .
russian oil giant yu ##kos , whose output will be shipped through the pipeline , had lobbied furiously for the chinese route although the state pipeline monopoly trans ##ne ##ft argued that it was wrong to tie strategic russian energy resources to the w ##him ##s of a single buyer .
" single customers are always a danger .
however , the project makes economic sense , " commented asia expert dmitry tre ##nin , deputy director in moscow of the carnegie center , a washington - based think tank .
the shorter chinese route , a 2 , 400 - kilometre project , would cost around half the japanese pipeline , at 2 . 5 billion dollars ( 2 . 15 billion euros ) , and would need to transport just 20 million tonnes a year to be economic .
china , whose booming economy has turned the country into an increasingly valuable economic partner for russia , especially in its backward far eastern regions , is also a major purchase ##r of russian weapons .
" it ' s a very important relationship .
china is a very dynamic neighbour and a rising world power .
in many ways it is far ahead of russia , " tre ##nin said .
the chinese president expressed the hope that bilateral trade could be raised from its current level of 12 billion dollars a year to 20 billion dollars .
analysts however caution ##ed against any attempt to turn the focus from economic cooperation to a broader strategic alliance , given that both sides opposed the war in iraq .
" the chinese are trying to establish a rap ##port ( between hu and putin ) and this is in russia ' s interests .
however , this rap ##port should not serve the role of forming an alliance to counter american dominance in the world , " said tre ##nin .
" a lot can be said for an ami ##cable , neighbour ##ly relationship between moscow and beijing and this is what the rap ##port should serve , " he added .

attention - adds russian foreign minister , us official quotes / / /
saint petersburg , june 1 ( af ##p ) - us president george w . bush and russian president vladimir putin said sunday their friendship was as strong as ever , laying aside a dispute over the iraq war , but barely conceal ##ing a sim ##mering row over iran ' s nuclear program .
after talks in saint petersburg ' s grand konstantin ##ovsky palace , they also warned north korea to abandon its nuclear aspirations and signed documents implementing the moscow treaty , which mandates sharp cuts in cold war nuclear weapons stocks .
swap ##ping smiles , hands ##hak ##es and hugs at a joint press appearance after talks linked to saint petersburg ' s 300 ##th anniversary celebrations , bush and putin set out to rec ##reate the buddy atmosphere of their previous encounters .
" our relations are stronger than the events that tested it , " said putin , stress ##ing that despite diver ##ging over iraq , russia and the united states had many common interests .
" it is precisely these things that enable me to call president bush my friend , not only personally - - because i do like him a lot - - but as my counterpart and the president of a friendly nation , " he said , earning a grin from bush .
but both men observed an uneasy truce over us concerns about russian aid to the nuclear program of iran , whom bush has labeled part of an " axis of evil " that also included iraq and north korea .
" we are concerned about iran ' s advanced nuclear program and urge iran to comply in full with its obligations under the nuclear non - proliferation treaty , " bush said .
a senior us diplomat said bush ##eh ##r remains one of the biggest ir ##ritan ##ts in russia - us relations .
" we think that it would be wise for russia to go slow on the bush ##eh ##r project until the wider iranian nuclear program is more clearly understood , " the us diplomat said after the informal summit talks .
" our belief is that any proliferation , coming from any source , should be stopped . "
the united states believes that what iran says is a peaceful civilian nuclear program is a pre ##text for weapons manufacture .
washington has been press ##uring russia to stop building a nuclear power plant in bush ##eh ##r , southern iran , which it has so far declined to do .
" i appreciate vladimir putin ' s understanding of the issue and his willingness to work with me and others to solve this potential problem , " said bush .
putin insisted that the two sides were " closer than they seem " on the issue .
" we do not need to be convinced of the fact that there should no proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , " he said .
but in a sharp remark that jolted the bon ##hom ##ie , putin warned russia was not yet ready to se ##ver nuclear ties with iran .
" we are against the pre ##text of using the nuclear weapons program in iran as a lever in unfair business competition against us , " he said .
bush signal ##led that russia would not pay a similar price as france and germany for opposing the us - led war in iraq , inviting his " good friend " putin to his weekend retreat outside camp david in washington in september .
putin last visited bush at his texas ranch in november 2001 .
there was no word on the fate of billions of dollars of russian oil contracts in iraq , whose oil industry is now under the administration of the united states and britain in line with latest un resolutions , which russia was persuaded to back .
but putin noted that " russian companies have a wealth of experience operating in iraq and we intend to continue our cooperation in this area , with iraq and in iraq .
"
" what the president ( putin ) meant was that at times , and we have come across this , there were unreasonable complaints about russian companies ' cooperation with iran , " said foreign minister igor ivanov , pointing the finger clearly at the united states after the summit .
bush and putin also signed formal documents putting into effect a strategic arms reduction treaty that slash ##es the two sides ' nuclear weapons to a range of 1 , 700 to 2 , 200 nuclear war ##heads by the year 2012 .
bush arrived in saint petersburg on saturday , when he also briefly met german chancellor gerhard sc ##hr ##oed ##er , whose opposition to the iraq war had sour ##ed his relationship with washington , at a dinner hosted by putin .
bush and putin were scheduled to leave straight after their talks for the group of eight summit of the largest industrial ##ised nations in ev ##ian , france .

israel hands over raf ##ah border crossing to palestinians attention - rec ##ast ##s with return to pre - int ##if ##ada positions , adds details / / /
gaza city , june 30 ( af ##p )
palestinian security forces returned monday to the positions they held in the gaza strip before the outbreak of the 33 - month palestinian uprising as israel removed all major checkpoint ##s in the coastal territory , a palestinian security source said .
police officers took up their positions across the gaza strip , enjoying a freedom of movement they have not known since the int ##if ##ada exploded in september 2000 , the source said .
" palestinian police have taken over all the posts and positions they held before september 28 , 2000 .
it is the first time they have had freedom of movement with cars and weapons since the start of the int ##if ##ada , " the source said .
the move marked a huge step forward in carrying out the us - backed middle east " road ##ma ##p " , which aims to end the months of blood ##shed and create a lasting peace between israel and the palestinians .
following the withdrawal of israeli troops from the northern town of beit han ##oun late sunday , police took up positions there and in the neighbouring town of beit la ##hi ##ya , he said .
they also deployed along the border with israel .
the hand ##over is a credibility test for the palestinian authority , which must show it means business when it comes to rein ##ing in hard ##line groups plotting attacks on the jewish state .
in another first in the almost three - year int ##if ##ada , the israeli army allowed palestinians free circulation on the trans - gaza highway as troops abandoned three major checkpoint ##s across the coastal territory .
traffic was flowing freely through the net ##zar ##im junction , just south of gaza city , the kiss ##uf ##im junction by dei ##r al - bala ##h in the central gaza strip , and the guest house junction just south of dei ##r al - bala ##h after the army withdrew .
the three military checkpoint ##s on the highway , which runs the entire length of the gaza strip , had transformed the trip from north to south , or ##dina ##rily a 30 - minute ride , into a grinding two or three - hour ordeal and came to symbol ##ise the horrors of occupation .
" israel has implemented most of the agreement except for a few issues , " the source said , pointing out that israel had still not removed two military observation posts at the kiss ##uf ##im junction and the guest house junction .
although there was free movement along the trans - gaza highway , several other roads remained temporarily closed , he said .
the ka ##rn ##i - net ##zar ##im road , which runs east - to - west across the route , was still closed as was the section of the highway passing close by k ##far dar ##om settlement , just south of the guest house junction , he said , adding both were likely to be opened in the coming weeks .
another road , leading from the southern border town of raf ##ah to khan yun ##is , would be opened within 10 days , he said .
ad ##ress ##ing palestinian complaints , an israeli military source confirmed troops had installed a gate at the net ##zar ##im crossing and at the southern guest house junction but said that they were only there for when jewish settlers needed to use the road .
a ban on palestinian men under the age of 35 being allowed to move freely was still in force but that was expected to be lifted later on monday or early tuesday .
the army also handed over control of raf ##ah border crossing between the gaza strip and egypt to the palestinians , security sources said .
six palestinian police officers were allowed to return to the palestinian section of the border crossing , which had been taken over by israeli troops shortly after the start of the uprising .
under the 1993 oslo accord ##s , which granted a measure of autonomy to the palestinians , the raf ##ah border crossing with egypt was to be jointly managed by both israel and the palestinians , although israel had final control over the zone .
although the crossing has , in principle , been open for movement between the two territories - - while being frequently closed by israeli for reasons rarely explained - - the palestinian section has been manned by israel for more than two years .

white house raises possibility it might not seek u . n . vote with eu - gen - - turkey - us - iraq ; un - gen - - n - iraq
washington ( ap )
with opposition harden ##ing , the white house left open the possibility tuesday that it would not seek a united nations vote on its war - making resolution if the measure was headed for defeat .
` ` the vote is desirable .
it is not necessary , ' ' presidential spokesman ari fl ##eis ##cher said .
the comments came as president george w . bush and his advisers looked beyond the diplomatic showdown and made plans for a public relations build ##up to potential war .
one option under serious consideration was bush giving iraqi leader saddam hussein a final ultimatum , perhaps with a short - term deadline , in a major address next week , two senior white house officials said .
the officials , who spoke on condition of an ##ony ##mity , stressed that a variety of options are on the table and they all depend on the outcome of a u . n . security council debate on the u . s . - backed war resolution .
the united states still does n ' t have the nine votes needed to win approval of the resolution , according to supporters and opponents , and many und ##ec ##ided council members are looking for a compromise .
even if he gets the required votes , bush needs to avoid a veto by russia , france or china who all favor continuing inspections at least into july .
once the vote is resolved one way or another , bush will int ##ens ##ify his case for war , officials said , barr ##ing un ##for ##ese ##en events such as saddam suddenly di ##sar ##ming or going into exile .
in addition to a possible address , they have discussed a presidential news conference and a cabinet meeting as ways for bush to communicate his plans to the nation next week .
as those discussions were taking place behind the scenes , fl ##eis ##cher told reporters that turkey would lose a proposed $ 15 billion aid package unless it admits troops into the country for the iraq conflict .
` ` the particular package that we ' ve been talking to them about was pre ##dicated on assistance and cooperation in any plan for the use of force against iraq , ' ' fl ##eis ##cher said .
until tuesday , the spokesman had suggested part of the package would be available to turkey regardless of whether 62 , 000 american troops are allowed in the country .
white house officials said they were turning up pressure on turkey in hopes that the parliament would grant the u . s . request on a second vote .
even so , officials said future aid for turkey would not be ruled out , just the massive package under consideration now .
at the united nations , secretary - general ko ##fi anna ##n called baghdad ' s missile destruction ` ` a positive development , ' ' putting him at odds with bush ' s assessment .
russia ' s foreign minister igor ivanov , harden ##ing moscow ' s opposition to quick military action , indicated russia may use its veto against the u . s . - backed resolution .
both developments further complicated bush ' s efforts to win passage of the resolution , adding significance to talk of what the administration would do if u . n . opposition cement ##s against the u . s . position .
` ` the president has made clear , that . . . whether the united nations votes or does not vote , that we will di ##sar ##m saddam hussein with a coalition of the willing , ' ' fl ##eis ##cher said .
` ` we are proceeding with all the plans for the vote . ' '
` ` now , if you are asking me if all of a sudden support around the world cr ##umble ##s and there is absolutely no one for it , i ca n ' t predict with metaphysical ce ##rti ##tu ##de every eventual ##ity , ' ' fl ##eis ##cher said .
u . s . ambassador john negro ##pon ##te was asked whether the united states would withdraw the resolution if it did n ' t have the votes to pass it .
` ` we have n ' t crossed that bridge , ' ' he said .
` ` we believe that support should be there .
we are not facing that kind of situation but we will cross the bridge when we come to it . ' '
afterward , he and other white house officials said the remarks did not signal a lack of confidence in the resolution ' s prospects .

mir ##jana marko ##vic , the power behind the scenes during milos ##evic ' s 13 - year reign , is accused of illegally providing their grandson ' s nanny with a state - owned luxury apartment in belgrade in 2000 .
the belgrade district court said that marko ##vic will be tried along with 10 other milos ##evic - era officials who face similar charges of ` ` inappropriate use of state property ' ' that carry a sentence of up to five years in jail .
the trial will start on march 13 , the court said .
milos ##evic and his wife wi ##eld ##ed enormous power in yugoslavia for more than a decade before he was swept out of power after a popular revolt in october 2000 .
the post - milos ##evic government later extra ##dit ##ed him to the u . n . war crimes tribunal in the hague , the netherlands .
since then , many of milos ##evic ' s political and business allies as well as his two children have been accused of crimes .
marko ##vic , the leader of the neo - communist yugoslav left party , lost her parliamentary immunity from prosecution after she failed to become a deputy in the parliament of serbia and montenegro , the country that last month succeeded yugoslavia .

em ##bold ##ened by u . n . report , iraq calls for end to sanctions
baghdad , iraq ( ap )
em ##bold ##ened by the latest weapons inspectors ' report , iraq on saturday called on the united nations to remove cr ##ip ##pling sanctions and to ban weapons of mass destruction in the entire middle east _ and eventually in the united states .
iraq resumed destroying banned al sam ##oud 2 missiles under u . n . supervision saturday after taking a day off , crushing six more in a process that chief inspector hans b ##li ##x called a ` ` substantial measure of di ##sar ##mament . ' '
in the past week , iraq has destroyed 40 of its 100 al sam ##oud 2 missiles , prohibited by the united nations because some tests indicated they could fly farther than 150 kilometers ( 93 miles ) .
it also has been destroying equipment used to make them .
reports to the security council on friday by b ##li ##x and chief nuclear inspector mohammed el ##bara ##de ##i praised iraq ' s recent compliance .
but inspectors also questioned iraq ' s motivation , as it began to give the inspectors what they wanted only when the threat of war became immediate .
u . s . president george w . bush said the reports indicated that only a war will make iraq di ##sar ##m .
` ` unfortunately , it is clear that saddam hussein is still violating the demands of the united nations by refusing to di ##sar ##m , ' ' he told americans in a radio address saturday .
iraq , however , took the report as an endorsement of its work and argued not only that war plans should be canceled , but that sanctions imposed on it by the security council for its 1990 invasion of kuwait should be removed .
` ` we demand that the security council and the world decide on . . . the lifting of sanctions on iraq in a comprehensive and complete way , ' ' said a spokesman for a meeting saturday of saddam and top - level officials , quoted by official iraqi news media .
the unidentified spokesman claimed the weapons inspectors had verified iraq has rid itself of weapons of mass destruction _ something the inspectors said would take months to do _ and appealed for a ban on such weapons to be extended beyond iraq : to israel , and eventually to the united states .
the spokesman , reporting on the meeting , said iraq called on the security council ` ` to rid the middle east of weapons of mass destruction since iraq has become free of them . ' '
` ` at the front of those that must be rid of these weapons is the zionist entity , ' ' he said in a reference to israel , adding that the order should ` ` move on after this region to america . ' '
the newspaper ba ##bil , a popular daily owned by saddam ' s son o ##dai , also said saturday that the reports of b ##li ##x and el ##bara ##de ##i were enough to suspend the sanctions , which are to be removed when the united nations ve ##ri ##fies that iraq has no weapons of mass destruction or the means to make them .
in a front - page editorial , ba ##bil said the reports should push security council members ` ` to think seriously about issuing a resolution lifting the sanctions imposed on iraq , since it was proven that we do n ' t possess weapons of mass destruction . ' '
saddam has long claimed iraq destroyed all its weapons of mass destruction .
the united states and britain claim he ' s lying , and have assembled a quarter - million troops around iraq for a possible invasion .
despite iraq ' s demands of the security council , diplomats were working hard on very different proposals : a u . s . - led plan for di ##sar ##mament or war by march 17 , and a rival french plan for an emergency summit of security council members to come up with a compromise .
bush and top advisers planned to lobby allies by telephone through the weekend and up until next week ' s planned vote on the ultimatum . french president jacques chi ##rac talked to heads of state in an effort to drum up support for his plan , his office said .
inspectors ' spokesman hi ##ro u ##eki said iraqi workers crushed six al sam ##oud 2 missiles saturday at the al - ta ##ji military complex north of baghdad , under the supervision of weapons inspectors .
three of the missiles had war ##heads and three did n ' t , apparently because they had n ' t been deployed .
inspectors also supervised the destruction of tools and ` ` special equipment used to produce the al sam ##oud 2 engine ' ' at the al sam ##oud factory , he said , and another group of inspectors verified the empty ##ing of al sam ##oud 2 war ##heads at the q ##a q ##a complex just south of baghdad .
o ##dai al - tai ##e , a senior information ministry official , said the workers crushing the missiles took friday off because they had worked on tuesday , the muslim new year .
u ##eki described friday as a ` ` planning day ' ' for teams working on missile destruction .
u ##eki said an iraqi chemical scientist granted an interview to weapons inspectors , bringing to eight the number of scientists who have given interviews since feb . 28 , when iraq began urging them to talk .
since the same date , four scientists have refused .
interviews with nuclear scientists have been conducted more frequently because the nuclear inspectors do n ' t mind the scientists tape recording the interviews , a sticking point for the chemical and biological teams .
inspectors also returned to a former helicopter airfield where iraq buried bombs it says were armed with biological weapons in 1991 .
u ##eki said inspectors there took samples from the remainder ##s of stainless steel containers iraq says it used to transport biological agents .

report : hong kong jockey club in talks to acquire its macau rival
hong kong ( ap )
the hong kong jockey club is in talks about buying out the horse racing club in neighboring macau , a newspaper reported tuesday .
the south china morning post quoted hong kong jockey club chief executive lawrence wong as saying the discussions were underway , but no price was reported .
the hong kong club is a charitable entity , while the macau jockey club is a for - profit concern controlled by gambling ty ##co ##on stanley ho .
hong kong angered macau ' s gaming industry last year when it banned gamble ##rs in hong kong from placing horse bets with anyone but the hong kong jockey club .
macau had been taking off - track bets from people in hong kong , but the offices handling those wage ##rs were closed .
the macau club later threatened to start taking wage ##rs on hong kong races in macau , at a better price for gamble ##rs because less tax would be levi ##ed , but the plan never materialized .
neither club immediately returned phone calls from the associated press to in ##qui ##re about the buy ##out talks .
macau is a gambling enclave 60 kilometers ( 40 miles ) west of hong kong that was governed by the portuguese for more than four centuries before it returned to chinese sovereignty in 1999 .
hong kong , a former british colony , returned to chinese rule in 1997 .

turkish party leader rec ##ep tay ##yi ##p er ##dog ##an named prime minister , may push to allow in u . s . troops
ankara , turkey ( ap )
the charismatic leader of turkey ' s governing party was named prime minister tuesday , a step that probably boost ##s chances that the united states will get permission to deploy troops in the country along iraq ' s northern border .
rec ##ep tay ##yi ##p er ##dog ##an , who favors the deployment , hinted that he will res ##hu ##ffle the cabinet , but gave no indication if he would purge officials who opposed letting in the troops as analysts have suggested he might do .
er ##dog ##an is extremely popular in turkey and is likely be one of the few leaders with enough cl ##out to unite his party and gain public support for allowing in the u . s . troops .
turks overwhelmingly oppose a war _ by 94 percent , according to some polls .
earlier this month , the turkish parliament shocked the united states by rejecting the deployment by just four votes .
er ##dog ##an has hinted that he will res ##ub ##mit the resolution for approval , which could take another week .
the united states is pressing turkey to act quickly .
ships carrying equipment for u . s . troops are already waiting off the turkish coast
in washington , joint chiefs of staff chairman gen . richard myers told a pentagon news conference tuesday that the united states would ` ` have a northern option whether or not turkey fully supports all our requests .
` ` i ' m not going to talk about the operational ways of doing it , but just be assured there will be a northern option , ' ' he said .
also in washington , turkish ambassador far ##ouk logo ##gl ##u told the associated press that the u . s . and turkish mil ##ita ##ries were holding informal discussions on the use of turkish airspace .
the troop - basin ##g resolution would allow the united states to use turkish airspace .
if the resolution is not passed , washington would likely want to use the airspace for strikes against iraq and for airlift ##ing troops to northern iraq .
refusing access to the troop deployment would mean turkey would lose a us $ 15 billion u . s . aid package that washington has offered to help cushion the country ' s economy if there is war .
it would also threaten turkey ' s possible role in the future of iraq . turkey , which fears northern iraqi ku ##rds may declare independence in the aftermath of a war , has been pressing for a say if saddam hussein is ousted .
secession by iraqi ku ##rds could inspire turkey ' s rebel ku ##rds , who for 15 years have been fighting for autonomy .
after he was elected , er ##dog ##an said turkey wanted assurance ##s from the united states on its role in iraq .
defense secretary donald h . rum ##sf ##eld said tuesday there had been talks that turkish troops could be deployed ` ` a short distance from their border to try to avoid refugee in ##filtration . ' '
iraqi ku ##rds fear that turkish troops could move deep into the autonomous enclave in northern iraq and have threatened clashes .
rum ##sf ##eld also said that like turkey , the united states does n ' t want to see a breakaway state : ` ` our interest , needles ##s to say , is to see that iraq remains a single country , ' ' he said at the pentagon news conference .
prime minister abdullah gu ##l resigned earlier tuesday to make way for er ##dog ##an , who won a parliamentary seat in by - elections sunday .
gu ##l will remain as a caretaker prime minister until president ah ##met nec ##de ##t se ##zer approve ##s er ##dog ##an ' s cabinet , a move that could happen as early as wednesday .
er ##dog ##an said he would submit his cabinet list to the president ` ` as soon as possible , ' ' and leaders of er ##dog ##an ' s justice and development party met tuesday evening .
when asked about possible changes in the cabinet , er ##dog ##an said : ` ` perhaps there will be a small amount of change , a certain number of revisions . ' '
gu ##l ' s resignation had been long expected .
er ##dog ##an heads the party but was constitutional ##ly barred from running in november elections because he was jailed in 1999 for anti - secular activities .
the justice party changed the constitution after taking power in the elections .
er ##dog ##an , a leader of turkey ' s pro - islamic movement when he was jailed , said he moderate ##d his policies in prison .
his party considers itself conservative and no longer uses the word ' islamic ' in its literature .
he now also advocates letting in u . s . troops for a war against iraq even though it is a fellow muslim state .
unlike the soft - spoken gu ##l , er ##dog ##an has a reputation as a fighter .
` ` er ##dog ##an will be willing to engage in a br ##uising confrontation in a way that gu ##l was not willing to , ' ' said bu ##lent ali ##riz ##a , an analyst at the washington - based center for strategic and international studies . ` ` if er ##dog ##an decides that for his own reasons , and not u . s . pressure , he wants this , he will push it through . ' '
tensions over the basin ##g agreement spilled over into parliament tuesday when opposition deputy u ##fu ##k oz ##kan shouted ` ` you are all american lack ##ey ##s ! ' '
at members of er ##dog ##an ' s party , the anatolia news agency reported .
a furious justice party member , fe ##hmi hu ##sr ##ev ku ##tl ##u , rushed toward oz ##kan , bump ##ing into him and sending his eye ##glass ##es flying , anatolia reported .
other legislators surrounded the two to head off a brawl .

eu rift over iraq remains as france , germany den ##oun ##ce u . s . move to war
brussels , belgium ( ap )
europe ' s divide over iraq loomed ever larger tuesday with france and germany den ##oun ##cing the u . s . move toward war while british prime minister tony blair said ou ##sti ##ng saddam hussein now was key to solving similar crises in the future .
as european union leaders rest ##ated their opposing views on iraq , their foreign ministers debated the impending u . s . - led war against iraq with eu president greece keeping up appearances with a pledge to pursue a last ditch effort to avoid war .
jo ##sch ##ka fischer and dominique de ville ##pin , the german and french foreign ministers , were to attend a special united nations security council meeting in new york wednesday , called to issue a last - minute appeal for a peaceful solution to the iraq crisis .
' ' for us the united nat ##gio ##ns is the key authority ' ' in resolving the iraq crisis , fischer told reporters op ##n arrival at the eu meeting .
' ' war is not justified , ' ' fish ##cer told reporters . ' '
as members of the united nations security council we want to rest ##ate that we want a peace ##fi ##ul solution . ' '
de ville ##pin made no comment on arrival .
ahead of the eu meeting , greek foreign minister geo ##rh ##ge papa ##nd ##re ##ou told reporters , ' ' we have to , and we will continue , to search for a peaceful solution to the crisis . ' '
the eu meeting could not hide the fact the iraq crisis has made a mock ##ery of eu aspirations to craft a common foreign policy .
britain , spain , denmark , italy , the netherlands and portugal back the united states while france and germany lead a group of nations opposing military action .
` ` i would like to see that the european union countries will come through this difficult moment with a determination to work for peace and look to the future , ' ' eu foreign policy chief javier sol ##ana said .
british foreign secretary jack straw remained in london for a debate in which the blair government sought parliamentary approval for its decision to use ` ` all means necessary ' ' to di ##sar ##m saddam .
blair was confident of retaining the support of a majority of parliament as he can count on votes from opposition conservatives .
he told the house of commons the iraq crisis was testing the fundamental ##s of international relations .
` ` it will determine the way britain and the world confront the central security threat of the 21st century ; the development of the united nations ; the relationship between europe and the united states ; the relations within the european union ; and the way that the united states engages with the rest of the world , ' ' said blair .
` ` it will determine the pattern of international politics for the next generation , ' ' he said .
the eu foreign ministers met hours after u . s . president george w . bush gave saddam 48 hours to leave iraq or face invasion .
french president jacques chi ##rac said war without u . n blessing would undermine future di ##sar ##mament efforts .
` ` inspections ( in iraq ) showed that they are a credible alter ##nat ##iv , ' ' chi ##rac said .
` ` to act without the legitimacy of the united nations . . . to favor the use of force over law , is taking a serious responsibility . ' '
in berlin , german chancellor gerhard sc ##hr ##oed ##er said there was no justification for war .
` ` does the threat posed by the iraqi dictator justify a war , which is sure to kill thousands of innocent children , women and men ?
my answer in this case was and is : no ! ' '
sc ##hr ##oed ##er said .
sol ##ana said the eu would help in the humanitarian crisis expected to follow an attack on iraq .
the eu is set to release 20 million euros ( us $ 21 . 5 million ) in immediate humanitarian aid for iraq if war breaks out and may dip into an ` ` emergency reserve ' ' of 250 million euros ( us $ 269 million ) for humanitarian relief .
elsewhere in europe : _ belgian prime minister guy ve ##rh ##of ##stadt , over ##ru ##ling his defense minister , said his government would allow the united states use of its territory for military transports .
in recent weeks , the u . s . military has been transporting military equipment from bases in germany to the gulf through the port of antwerp . defense minister andre fl ##aha ##ut said on the weekend belgium would no longer allow such transit ##s _ or use of belgian airspace .
_ greece began eva ##cu ##ating its embassy in baghdad , saying all its personnel would be out of iraq within a couple of days .
_
the dutch government , facing strong public anti - war pressure , said it would not commit fighting forces to the war against iraq but added it supported the military campaign to di ##sar ##m saddam .
_
in neutral switzerland , foreign minister michel ##ine calm ##y - rey said the united states ' decision to proceed with military action weakened the united nations .
` ` it will be up to u . n . member states to restore its credibility , ' ' she said .

southern iraq ( ap )
u . s . and british troops were moving on the strategic southern port city of bas ##ra saturday after a massive aerial assault pounded baghdad at dawn .
thousands of bel ##ea ##gue ##red iraqi soldiers in the south surrendered in the face of the major push .
the battle for bas ##ra , an oil hub of some 1 . 3 million people , was underway by midday , with coalition troops trying to surround iraqi positions and force a surrender .
u . s . aircraft bombed iraqi tanks holding bridges close to the city .
iraqi forces responded with artillery fire .
earlier saturday , baghdad was again targeted , one day after a massive u . s . aerial bombardment in which more than 300 tom ##aha ##wk cruise missiles rained down on the capital .
the nine - story security headquarters in the iraqi capital took a direct hit , st ##rew ##ing bricks , masonry and glass across the street in the al - sal ##hi ##ya neighborhood of central baghdad .
as coalition troops advanced , an entire iraqi army division gave itself up , u . s . military officials said .
the division
_
the 51st infantry division , with 8 , 000 men and as many as 200 tanks , a key unit in the defense of bas ##ra
_
was the largest defect ##ion in a day when iraqi leader saddam hussein ' s forces showed signs of crumbling .
allied successes were marred by the collision of two royal navy helicopters over the persian gulf in which all six british crew members and one american were killed .
saturday morning , american marines and british troops rumbled along the main road from the kuwait ##i border to bas ##ra , highway 80 , nicknamed the ` ` highway of death ' ' during the 1991 gulf war , when u . s . airs ##tri ##kes wiped out an iraqi military convoy along it .
american units advancing west of bas ##ra have already secured the rum ##eil ##a oil field , whose daily output of 1 . 3 million barrels makes it iraq ' s most productive .
until bas ##ra , u . s . and british troops had encountered little resistance , even when they seized nearby umm q ##as ##r , and moved to secure key oil fields .
iraqi ##s mostly fought back with small arms , pistols , machine guns and rocket - propelled grenades .
regular iraqi forces had withdrawn from bas ##ra but elements of saddam ' s security forces are continuing to resist , british defense secretary geoff ho ##on said saturday .
other units moved into airfield complexes in western iraq believed to have sc ##ud missiles capable of reaching israel , and possibly weapons of mass destruction .
early saturday , more units were waiting in kuwait to smash through any iraqi resistance .
hundreds of tanks , armored personnel carriers , hum ##ve ##es and trucks were lined up in parallel columns waiting in single - file to cross the iraqi - kuwait border .
by early next week , u . s . ground forces led by the army ' s 3rd infantry division are likely to be at the outskirts of baghdad , where they could face greater danger from the republican guard , some commanders said .
after weeks of delay , turkey re ##lent ##ed and agreed to let combat aircraft fly over its territory .
at the same time , however , turkey sent 1 , 000 troops into northern iraq , and the government said it would send more to prevent iraqi ku ##rds from creating an independent state .
the united states strongly opposes any un ##ila ##tera ##l move by turkey into northern iraq .
a turkish military spokesman on saturday denied turkish troops had crossed into iraq .
the united states and britain suffered their first casualties thursday and friday as they pushed into iraq , with two u . s . marines killed in combat and another eight british and four american marines dying in a helicopter crash that appeared to be accidental .
there was no clear figure of iraqi casualties .
australian commandos , who have been operating deep in iraq , destroyed a command and control post and killed a number of soldiers , according to the country ' s defense chief , gen . peter co ##sg ##rove .
in an address saturday , information minister mohammed sa ##eed al - sa ##hh ##af told iraqi ##s that fighting had been ` ` fierce . ' '
he said most of those captured by allied forces were civilians , not soldiers .
he claimed iraqi troops had destroyed five tanks .
he said more than 200 iraqi ##s had been injured , including women , children and other civilians who were being treated at five hospitals in baghdad .
ho ##on said saddam ' s regime was crumbling under the pressure of a huge air assault .
` ` as last night ' s dramatic television coverage showed , the lights stayed on in baghdad , but the instruments of ty ##ran ##ny are collapsing , ' ' he said .
iraqi vice president ta ##ha ya ##sin rama ##dan , speaking on iraqi radio , was quoted by the british broadcasting corp . ' s monitoring service as accusing britain and the united states of working to ` ` eliminate ' ' the state of iraq .
in a letter to u . n . secretary - general ko ##fi anna ##n , rama ##dan said , ` ` it is also regret ##table and de ##pl ##ora ##ble that the ( u . n . ) general secretariat has not issued any statement or reaction that condemn ##s or de ##pl ##ores this aggression . ' '
despite the heavy bombing , which the u . s . central command said targeted military command and control installations , the iraqi regime gave no sign of quit ##ting .
bombers have also hit targets in the northern cities of mo ##sul , kirk ##uk and ti ##kr ##it , saddam ' s hometown .
the iraqi government released a video of saddam , in uniform , meeting with his son qu ##sai , the commander of the republican guard , and the defense minister , gen . sultan hash ##im ahmad .
it was unclear when the video was made .
u . s . intelligence officials said the iraqi command and control system was in di ##sar ##ray , and u . s . defense secretary donald rum ##sf ##eld said , ` ` the regime is starting to lose control of their country . ' '
